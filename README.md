1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,300
 what

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:39,300
 Yeah, right. How you going?

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
 Adele. Great.

4
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,300
 You.

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,300
 Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
 Sorry.

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,300
 Yeah.

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,300
 Nathan will join us soon.

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
 Right here.

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,300
 Oh, nice.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,300
 Hi.

12
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,300
 Oh really.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:36,300
 Yeah, Nathan. Nathan to join us.

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,300
 You get that sorted.

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
 Yep.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
 Right.

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
 Hello.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,300
 Yeah, I don't know. The link disappeared. It was there this morning.

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,300
 Yeah.

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
 Yeah, it's gone.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 Short not user error?

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
 I don't know. Anyway, we're here.

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
 It's user error.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,300
 Yeah, it might.

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
 Yeah, it might probably.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,300
 And Pete should be dialing in as well.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
 Oh, they're not in Newcastle.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
 Ben's here and Pete's not.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
 Oh, okay. G'day, Ben.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
 Hey, how are you?

31
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
 You good mate, yourself?

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,300
 Good, thank you. I'm trying to multitask. I'm trying to put your program into our program, as we speak.

33
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,300
 Did Warwick give you what you were after?

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
 Yep, perfect. I've just got it down.

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:35,300
 Good, good, good. Because I reminded him and then he forgot again. And then I reminded him again and then I think he did it, but I didn't see the email.

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
 We're lucky we've got you, thank you.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
 Sorry?

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
 We're lucky we've got you, thank you.

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:48,300
 Well, I didn't really want you chasing me on a regular basis going, where the f*** is this program?

40
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
 How's it all looking?

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,300
 Just doing it now. Just want to see where the steel delivery turns up in yours.

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
 It's not pretty.

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:19,300
 So, what's the airport's take now on the steel? And I assume now that if the steel's not ready until September, is this going to mean that it's going to be a June finish date?

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:27,300
 Is the steel going to be that late? Like, that's what I want to understand, is what now becomes of the steel and the staging and everything that we're doing.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,300
 The steel at the moment, of the current design that we've got, arrives on site on the 4th of the 3rd.

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
 Of March?

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
 Yep.

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,300
 The first stages of steel is now the 4th of March?

49
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,300
 Yep. And you're at...

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,300
 That's Hutchins, that's Fassad.

51
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 This box in the back is yellow.

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,300
 Your March is...

53
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,300
 F***.

54
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:12,300
 Your stage 4 is the 13th of March.

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
 Okay, so...

56
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
 You're completely in front of the steel.

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:41,300
 So, but okay, you get the panels here and you've got to wait a couple of weeks. Good problem to have, because just looking at this tender process with Cox being involved and how much of a venture that's been, I can only imagine what the design process is going to be like with these guys once we start trying to push them to do all their interfaces, coordination with us and all that sort of shit.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,300
 So, you know, we're all going to have to be very, you know, on the ball with those guys, eh?

59
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
 Yes.

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,300
 Politically, saying it as politely as I can, because I don't want to say anything rude in front of Peter.

61
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:06,300
 It'll be, between Napple and the design team, it's going to be hard.

62
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:15,300
 I get the look on your face when I first met you and you told me about the way these guys work and I've only been around for eight, nine weeks.

63
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:24,300
 I said to Dale the other day, almost through my phone, across the office, when I saw one of Daniela's emails and I thought, f*** me dead.

64
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
 You have a meeting, there's minutes and then people just go off on a...

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
 Tangent.

66
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
 They just, yeah, they go off on another adventure.

67
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
 Yeah.

68
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:44,300
 What we wanted to do today is actually just literally go through your offer, understand all these inclusions and exclusions, what's in, what's out.

69
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:57,300
 Go through everything, sort of, if there's anything that needs to be revised, revise it, so then we can go back to Napple and say, well, this is it.

70
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 Here's a tender recommendation and, you know, the clock is ticking now because at the moment, sort of, from their perspective, the ball's all in our court and we haven't ordered the facade because we haven't put in a trade rec and we haven't done anything.

71
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,300
 So we just want to start to move that along.

72
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
 So I've done a quick markup.

73
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
 That's their smoke and mirrors of dealing with it, yeah?

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
 Yes.

75
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,300
 We all know what the overarching issues are.

76
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
 What blast are we doing?

77
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
 How much of it?

78
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
 What acoustic?

79
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:43,300
 Like, the design is nowhere, so we're going to obviously put forward, here's an offer and clearly spell out what that is and force them to make the decision.

80
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
 So I'll just share.

81
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:58,300
 If I assume it correctly, Paul's working parallel in the background with what we're doing today by getting the system over the line with Cox EA Connects and the phone calls that I've had with him over the last few days.

82
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:11,300
 It seems to be that he's like, this is the system, this is what we all have to work with, and then when you put your recommendation forward, there's not an argument about nobody didn't understand what they were getting.

83
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:24,300
 Mate, to be honest with them, they will still get nowhere and make no decision and tell us nothing.

84
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,300
 So Nathan, what's transpired over the last couple of days?

85
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,300
 Because I've seen that obviously they went, the architect wanted to review it.

86
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:44,300
 Dale, you may have mentioned that NAPL even said, oh no, it's not faceted, it's curved.

87
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
 Is that right?

88
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
 Straight.

89
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
 Yeah, yeah.

90
00:07:47,300 --> 00:08:02,300
 They didn't fully understand that we were creating straight panels to get getting rid of the facets, I think is the correct description.

91
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 But they understand that now because Paul has written it and called me this week a couple of times confirming that he understands that straight.

92
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:21,300
 Yeah, so they're doing another presentation to the sponsors because that's not what I told them originally.

93
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,300
 So going back to fucking square one.

94
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:39,299
 But that's after fucking Ben Kozowski went to the sponsors with what TFG supplied, which is what we talked about.

95
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:47,300
 Let's not talk logical or anything because there is no...

96
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,300
 No, no, no. I know if we go back over it, we're just going to lose the point.

97
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
 No, that's fine.

98
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:06,300
 So I've done a set of markup just highlighting things in your offer and I'm using REV5.

99
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
 That's the latest one that I have available to me.

100
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
 Let's suspend another one.

101
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:24,300
 Is that REV5 is the one that we submitted broken down the way Peter that you and I discussed needed to be done?

102
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
 Okay. All right.

103
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:45,300
 Yep. So just go and say it still has glass facade, you know, glass skylights in this offer up above and then you've given...

104
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:52,300
 Yes, that's not correct.

105
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,300
 I don't know why that's not the way it was meant to be broken down.

106
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
 So I don't know where that blast.

107
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 So the schedule I sent you, you responded to with some markup and changes of numbers.

108
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
 Yep.

109
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,300
 But we put the blast and the acoustics down the bottom.

110
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 So we went back to the basic facade with no acoustics and no blast based on the Cox design.

111
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
 Bang.

112
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
 Then we added the stuff.

113
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:36,300
 Have you got that dial that schedule I'd sent to TFG who then responded?

114
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 Yep. That's what you're talking about with their markup.

115
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
 You get that dial?

116
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
 Oh, this deal.

117
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
 Not that I'll do.

118
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
 You're talking to down even.

119
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
 Yeah.

120
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
 Yep.

121
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
 Yeah.

122
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
 We've lost our way.

123
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 Yeah.

124
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
 No, no.

125
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
 I'm just finding it.

126
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
 That's not right.

127
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
 This is the one that I've got.

128
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
 I need to...

129
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
 Can you guys see that?

130
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
 The Excel?

131
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
 No.

132
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
 You'll have to re-thorough.

133
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
 Yeah.

134
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,300
 Air-boobs technology.

135
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:31,300
 So this is the list that came after revision five that Peter asked us to fill out.

136
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:38,300
 And Dale, our Dale, went through and put those numbers against it to try and get as close

137
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 as we could to the breakdown that he had.

138
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
 So this is the breakdown.

139
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
 Yeah.

140
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 This was done miles in Thailand two and a half, three weeks ago, whatever it was.

141
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,300
 Yeah.

142
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,300
 That's sort of had, okay, so if you take out the non-blast, it should be that right.

143
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
 And you guys say, no, that's...

144
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,300
 So there's a few differences, minor differences, along the way.

145
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
 So what?

146
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
 Two hundred green.

147
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
 What's that between friends?

148
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
 Yeah.

149
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:18,300
 Now, the question is, you go down, so you've got non-blast-ended acoustics.

150
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
 So this was just a base system, right?

151
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
 Yeah.

152
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 Nothing special in the FD01.

153
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
 Yes.

154
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
 We ignore the other facade types just for a second.

155
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,300
 You go down a little bit, Dale, and you'll see that we added in, if you wanted, the different

156
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
 shopping items.

157
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
 If you go down a little bit, scroll down.

158
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:46,300
 So for FD01, add blast to item two was X, add jockey sash to airside, add blast, FD05.

159
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:54,300
 Which means, if we just applied this base rate, which is what we've done here, that's

160
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 what it should equal.

161
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
 Then you've got a hundred of green.

162
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,300
 That's for the standard RW35 acoustics, not the 46 or 43 that everyone's talking about.

163
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,300
 That was, when we priced the job, yeah, that's the base, base, base, standard system, 35RW,

164
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 non-blast.

165
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
 Yeah.

166
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,300
 So you're saying that this price allows for your RW46?

167
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 No.

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
 30RW.

169
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
 No.

170
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:34,300
 But then why is it not 1080 square meter, which equals 1.1 and you're at 1.286?

171
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
 Is that, Dale?

172
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 Yeah.

173
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
 Is that correct?

174
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
 Is what I just said correct?

175
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
 Actually, I...

176
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
 That's the value.

177
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
 These are the values we come up with.

178
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
 Yeah, I'm just asking Dale just to double check.

179
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 I wonder where those values are from.

180
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,300
 Well, we filled out the values on the right.

181
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
 Yeah.

182
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,300
 No, so originally you've got your original numbers, which might have been revision one,

183
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
 two or three, whatever it was.

184
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:10,300
 So we know those, the non-blast, FTO1 non-blast standard acoustics, which was one's air side

185
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
 and one's land side, right?

186
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
 They should be the same.

187
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:22,300
 I had this conversation with you some time ago, Nathan, and your first comment was that

188
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 there was engineering in it.

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:31,300
 I said, no, no, the engineering's above and then the acoustics and the rest of it's down

190
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
 the bottom.

191
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 So I don't think you ever gave me a clear explanation as to why, if we're going back

192
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 to the standard, both sides are the same, or the square metre should be the same.

193
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
 Yeah.

194
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
 I understood.

195
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:55,300
 And I understood there was the skylight, you know, because I just tried to bodgey up some

196
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 square metre rates off the work that you'd done.

197
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 And okay, we're 12 grand apart.

198
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,300
 That was okay.

199
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
 The non-blast standard acoustics was the same for the FTO2s.

200
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,300
 I was a bit out on the non-blast window standard acoustic FTO2 on the air side.

201
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 I don't know.

202
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,300
 Again, that's, you know, I'd come up, those square metre rates weren't as clear as the

203
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 1080, which was, you know, I had to bodgey those figures up.

204
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,300
 So I was, you know, that made sense to me.

205
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
 And then we had the.

206
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
 But this one's, this right here.

207
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
 Yeah, that I've got no explanation for that.

208
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
 Right.

209
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 So I don't understand why that should be any different.

210
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
 Because again, down the bottom, we're adding.

211
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:53,300
 So roll down the bottom because I, and I had the same issue with the blast because.

212
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
 Yeah.

213
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 The, out of your own numbers, it's an additional $403 a square metre.

214
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
 But you've got a different number there.

215
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
 Just give me a second.

216
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:21,300
 And the jockey sash, that calculation was just the difference between.

217
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,300
 So each time you priced it, you priced, you know, FTO1 plus acoustics.

218
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,300
 So it's just a matter of adding it on.

219
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
 So, yeah.

220
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 But you were less there.

221
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
 That's.

222
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,300
 The question I've got for you is on this.

223
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,300
 They're not going to take up the jockey sash anymore.

224
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
 Is from my understanding.

225
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
 Is that correct?

226
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,300
 Like what the exercise today is figure out what we believe they're going to ask for.

227
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 They're not going to take up the jockey sash.

228
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 They're just taking up the acoustic glass option at 40 system 43.

229
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 Right.

230
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
 Is that correct?

231
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,300
 Well, they haven't said anything to be honest.

232
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 Don't know.

233
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,300
 History tells us that they'll go, probably go have a long, hard think about it and work out why they're going to build a new terminal.

234
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,300
 That's lower performing than their existing.

235
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 That's really something that they need to.

236
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
 Where did that comment come from?

237
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
 Nathan, have you been told something?

238
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
 Yeah.

239
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
 I can access floating about.

240
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 Because they're gone off from a green star perspective.

241
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:42,300
 You know, we, you know, for acoustic comfort, it can go as low as 43 as a facade performance.

242
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 But that's significantly less than their existing facade in the existing terminal.

243
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:05,300
 And they've gone, oh, you know, it'll be 75 DB inside, which is the same as go turn your Uber on your vacuum and go, oh, that's the noise level.

244
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:17,300
 Okay.

245
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 Yeah, they asked about that initially.

246
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,300
 And then the last six or seven working days, Paul Malone's been pushing down a road with everyone.

247
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
 And he's called me a few times about it.

248
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
 And I told him my opinion.

249
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:40,300
 I said, look, I'm not you guys and I'm not the consultant architect, but I suggest putting a jockey sash on the airside.

250
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 And he said to me, no, we all seem pretty comfortable with this 43 RW.

251
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 And, you know, we're going to keep talking about that.

252
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
 And I said, okay, fine.

253
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
 I've said my piece and I've gone quiet.

254
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:59,300
 And I told him I was quiet in the meeting with NAPL the other week on purpose when Daniela raised it.

255
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:07,300
 And I said for the simple reason I didn't want to discredit what the architect was saying in front of everyone, because I imagine that I start the job off wrong.

256
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,300
 But now that I've got you on my own, Paul, I think you're thinking about the longevity of this job and people in that terminal.

257
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
 If you want to save half a million dollars, save it on something else.

258
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,300
 Don't save it on something that everyone hears 15 times a day.

259
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,300
 You know, these F-35 jets taking off, screaming through the building.

260
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
 And I said, that's what I'm suggesting.

261
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 The Joggy Shats is something they can retrofit later, isn't it?

262
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
 You can actually, and that's a good point.

263
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 You could mechanically fix one on later if it's an issue.

264
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,300
 You know, and that's maybe something else that if you build the building and they're like, no, this is just too much.

265
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 You know, we can, you can fit one, but they'll be mechanically fixed.

266
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
 So you would see.

267
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
 Yeah.

268
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,300
 What a great outcome for them.

269
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
 Yeah, it would look pretty.

270
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,300
 We just built this terminal and now they've got to go do all this acoustic treatment.

271
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
 Like, they're fucking mad.

272
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
 But anyways.

273
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:13,300
 So, I guess what I'm trying to get to is, what's the best?

274
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,300
 Because obviously you're asking us to put something forward that you're going to take to them.

275
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:28,300
 Do we go along the base facade with the 43 RW acoustics and then just have the optional pricing below the line to add the Joggy Sash on?

276
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:35,300
 My view is, we present the price the way we've got it now.

277
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,300
 The stock standard facade at the top.

278
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
 Yeah.

279
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
 What was our original offer.

280
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
 Yep.

281
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
 And then the shopping list below.

282
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
 Everything needs to be a shopping list.

283
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 So essentially what you've got there.

284
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
 Essentially what we've got there.

285
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 So if you don't, if they don't want the net now, sorry, I think there's probably an added one.

286
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,300
 What we've said at the top is that that's a standard 35, isn't it?

287
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 Correct.

288
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
 Right.

289
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
 Okay.

290
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
 So the top is the standard 35.

291
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,300
 There's non-blast standard, hang on, where am I?

292
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:24,300
 There's the, scroll down, Darl, can you?

293
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 Right.

294
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 So what I was trying to get to here is now, there's your stock standard as per Cox design or close enough, standard 35.

295
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 You want to add the blast?

296
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
 That's how much.

297
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,300
 You want to add the blast to item four or item six, there's your dollars.

298
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,300
 Then there was the upgrade to the jockey sash.

299
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
 Jockey sash, right.

300
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 That should be a RW51 option.

301
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
 Then we should have RW51.

302
00:21:51,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 Which, that's right, we write in RW51 and then we go, because it's a change in glass, isn't it?

303
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
 That's correct.

304
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:08,300
 We're making a, so I know what you're getting at, you're saying split item 11 into three scenarios.

305
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
 Yes.

306
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:19,300
 A jockey sash or RW43 to the whole building or RW43 just to the arrivals and jockey sash on the airside.

307
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
 So that way they can pick.

308
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,300
 So item 11, just my Dale, Dale.

309
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 Yeah.

310
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:32,300
 Are you able to split that into those three items on the spreadsheet?

311
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
 Yes.

312
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 Yeah.

313
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
 We know the rates, right?

314
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:46,300
 So that 581 gets divided now into three different pricing scenarios.

315
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
 Okay.

316
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,300
 Well, the 581 or your 490, that stays there as adding a jockey sash.

317
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
 Yeah.

318
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 That's just the number.

319
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:10,300
 Then we go 43 to airside or airside X dollars, 43 to both sides.

320
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
 Is that because, are they questioning?

321
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
 So you just, we just do it so that we know we can add.

322
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 Okay, you want that one?

323
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 Okay, we'll put that one in.

324
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
 You don't want that one?

325
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
 We'll take that one out.

326
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
 Okay, got it, got it, got it.

327
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
 I know what you want.

328
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
 So that way when they do make their mind up, they just need to pick it.

329
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
 That's what we're doing.

330
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
 That's the cost.

331
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
 Yeah.

332
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 Well, we need, somehow we've got to get this recommendation because whilst we still don't

333
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,300
 have the answers, they keep saying it's our problem that we should be getting the answers.

334
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
 But you're not in control of the architect.

335
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,300
 Even before we're struggling to get answers out of the architect, like they're intentionally

336
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 hijacking him, I reckon.

337
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
 I can see what they're doing to him on this job.

338
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
 They're not happy with NAPL.

339
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
 I can see the friction between them.

340
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 Oh, no, no, they're not.

341
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
 No.

342
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
 But it's their own fault too.

343
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 It's their own incompetence that's generated it.

344
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,300
 And compounded by an incompetent client.

345
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 So anyway.

346
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,300
 So we'll get that item 11 split up.

347
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 And then is that, that for me makes sense on everything that we're doing today, right?

348
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,300
 Like, as in pricing wise, we split that, we'll put it on the table.

349
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:31,300
 You need, you need, Dale, Lou, you need to, you need to come up with, I need to understand

350
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 why in the standard, right?

351
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 The rate between airside and landside is different.

352
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
 It should be the same.

353
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:49,300
 The other thing you've got to understand, Nathan, is they've got a bloke in there that's

354
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,300
 reviewing all these recommendations.

355
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,300
 He's fucking anal.

356
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,300
 He pulls through absolutely everything and he'll ask the question.

357
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,300
 And I can't, we have got to be clear.

358
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 If we're playing games, we're going to get busted.

359
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
 And in particular.

360
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
 No, no, no, we're not playing games.

361
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 There is a reason why we, it's, I'm telling you how he, how he thinks, right?

362
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 He's this, this is particularly difficult because it is a negotiate.

363
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
 You know, it didn't go out the tender.

364
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,300
 So like we've got an audit today, tomorrow, I think, haven't we, Dale?

365
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,300
 Dale, Dale, we've got an external order to coming in to check all the probity.

366
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
 Fucking.

367
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 Of course they do.

368
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 Yeah, I've never had it before.

369
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
 I've never had it before.

370
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 Never in my life.

371
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,300
 They like spending money on their, on this job, don't they?

372
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
 Just not the right places.

373
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,300
 Yeah, I was going to say not the right places.

374
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 Including, including.

375
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 $10 million worth of salaries for those fuckwits sitting up in the airport.

376
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 Anyway.

377
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,300
 Okay, so we'll get that updated.

378
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,300
 We'll put notes on item two for you and explain it.

379
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
 Dale and I will do that.

380
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,300
 And then do you want us to then drop this table into revision six pricing?

381
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 That becomes revision six.

382
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 So it's married together.

383
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
 You've got your schedule there and revision six and they're identical.

384
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
 Yeah.

385
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 Yeah.

386
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
 You want us to do that, Peter?

387
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
 Yes, please.

388
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 And that's the start of it.

389
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
 The next.

390
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 So, so if we're clear on this, then we just need to work through the rest of the notes.

391
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,300
 And that's something that we should have done several weeks ago and we haven't.

392
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 Is to go through all the inclusions and exclusions and just be clear.

393
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 The next thing to understand this GC21 contract.

394
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 We don't have any ability to claim a variation if we misscope.

395
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
 Yeah, I understand that.

396
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
 I'm sorry.

397
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 We pay it.

398
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 So we've got to be clear if there's stuff in here that is not included.

399
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 Should be included, whatever.

400
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 So that we know at the bottom we've got to either have trade reserves or make allowances for for other stuff.

401
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
 Because we only get one shot at it.

402
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,300
 Understood.

403
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
 Understood.

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 Okay.

405
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:30,300
 So I've just highlighted a heap of sort of more items, not that we agree or disagree, that we just need to get sometimes some clarity on or how we can firm things up.

406
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,300
 Like aluminium, like what's our risk or how do we lock that in?

407
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,300
 The LME's not been an issue at the moment.

408
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 So when you lock it in, it's locked away.

409
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 So if you award us a job based on the price that we put in on revision six, it's not a risk, right?

410
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
 As soon as we're awarded the job, that disappears.

411
00:27:51,300 --> 00:28:01,300
 What we're letting you know is just say in two weeks time you haven't let the job yet and next minute LME skyrockets to 3200 tonne, which it did do that during COVID.

412
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,300
 And it's the first time in my career in 20 years I've ever seen it.

413
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
 We only put that comment in there.

414
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,300
 So if something does happen, we come back and say, Steve, you haven't awarded us the job yet, but the LME's skyrocketed.

415
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
 We've got to tell you the bad news.

416
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 But at the moment, the risk is minimal on that.

417
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
 That's all.

418
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 The container.

419
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 With the containers, like how do we control how many containers?

420
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 No, no, you don't control it.

421
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 What we're saying there is what the architect is designed, we've catered for in our shipping and packing.

422
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:45,300
 If the architect turns around during the job and says, I want to increase modules, change heights, do all of that, well, then my container packing sequences changes and I could end up with more containers.

423
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,300
 And I'm alerting to the fact that I've allowed 40, which covers the entire job.

424
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
 Not a problem.

425
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 I've got a little bit of contingency of a couple of containers in there as well.

426
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:02,300
 And, you know, we do out. So another thing that happened during COVID, as you guys would be aware, shipping costs went through the roof.

427
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,300
 Right. They went from a few thousand a container up to 14 grand at one stage.

428
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,300
 Now we're saying we're very diligent.

429
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 We design Dale and the guys in Thailand, we design the panels to fit perfectly in the containers.

430
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,300
 We put a little bit of contingency on there in case of extra packs or whatever.

431
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:31,300
 But if the architect makes any changes, we'll be the first ones to put a hand up and say it's got to if it affects the container packing because it makes up 20 percent of our budget.

432
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,300
 Yeah. Containers do. So it's not for you.

433
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,300
 Once you're locked in the job and the design doesn't change, not a problem.

434
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:47,300
 But if they decide they want to change, you know, something in terms of modulation sizes, we've got to go back and have a look how that impacts the containers.

435
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,300
 That's all. I got to say, they haven't really given us like a window schedule panel break up yet.

436
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:05,300
 How do they. Well, we've taken the elevations and the layouts and determine the modules from there.

437
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,300
 We did our panel matrix, which gave us the sizes. And that's how we do our packing.

438
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:17,300
 So as long as that doesn't change in terms of. This is the problem by not giving the panel matrix to the.

439
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
 Have you given the panel matrix to the architects? No.

440
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:28,300
 We've given you guys. I don't think they know what to do with it, but we've only done the take off.

441
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 This is a different issue. You're telling me that if the architect changes.

442
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:47,300
 The size of these panels and the panel set out or instead of we've been 100 that they go to not we want now 3.6 is to make more big and pretty.

443
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,300
 We need to establish the baseline. Yeah. Yeah. But that's what I'm getting at.

444
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,300
 The drawings that they've given us is the baseline.

445
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 Right. You know, that's what I'm like, you know, that's what we based it on. It's based on their drawings.

446
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:07,300
 What we're saying is there we've done the pricing at 60 percent documentation when they get to 90 that aside, let's change all the modulations.

447
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,300
 That's a variation to you and I. That's a material change of the project.

448
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:19,300
 OK, well, that that clarification needs to be rewritten to expand it on to to explain that.

449
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:30,300
 So we've allowed for 40 containers, which which which any change to the module sizes, which etc.

450
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:37,300
 By by the design, by the by the client's design team.

451
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:50,300
 Now, that's by you getting this down. Yep. Yeah. And then says this will constitute a variation.

452
00:31:50,300 --> 00:32:00,300
 If more containers are required or something like that, we what we got to do is tell them that we worked off the current drawings, the 30 percent.

453
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:08,300
 It's a 30 or 60 percent. 60. We've worked off the 60. If you. Yeah. Yeah. So we actually need to put that in.

454
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 We've allowed for Mac based on the design contained within the 60 percent.

455
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:23,300
 Yep. Got that. We'll update that. Any changes to that layout may constitute a variation if more containers are required.

456
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:34,300
 And it's it's a it's a it's a it doesn't. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. But we're advising you because and if I want to argue this with this, Jamie, I'll go, well, my everything you fucking do changes.

457
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:40,300
 So, you know, we have to put that in. So the the aluminium price.

458
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 That's OK. It's a warning to you that if the LME was to go up to thirty two hundred in the next two weeks before you award me the job, I'd have to relook at my pricing at the moment. It's not an issue.

459
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 Yeah, well, it doesn't say that. No, no, no. But it doesn't say that.

460
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:13,300
 But LME is OK. It's just it's been an issue during COVID. I understand that we have allowed up to twenty three hundred dollars USD a metric tonne for aluminium.

461
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:21,300
 Yep. Now, now you're going to have to. So how do we prove that?

462
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:32,300
 So how do we prove that it's gone to twenty four or thirty two? Well, we use the LME, the actual LME website, which is a lot of metal exchange.

463
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:43,300
 And you look at you look at the spot rates. Now, I don't really care if you award the job in the next two weeks and it's twenty three fifty USD a tonne. I'm not going to talk to you about it.

464
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:53,300
 Really. It's only if there's a major spike, you know, this bloke will pick this up and and pull it apart and ask us how we're going to manage it.

465
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,300
 Well, it's not an issue. It's not an issue for you. Once the job's awarded, it becomes my issue. I manage that.

466
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:09,300
 That's right. I've just got to make it clear, mate, because we'll write that in there. I'll write that in there. Say upon award, our rate is locked and ours to manage.

467
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:20,300
 Yes. Yes. I'll put that in there upon award. So I'll finish that sentence with upon award. We lock this in and we manage this for the duration of the project.

468
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,300
 So I'll guarantee you he'll get onto the spot right now. It's at twenty one forty eight fifty.

469
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:39,300
 There you go. So, Dale, take the twenty three hundred out. Take line item two out and don't even put it in there. Just leave it. It's not an issue.

470
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,300
 Even to say, you know, aluminium, the price is based on aluminium. Spot rate.

471
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
 TAPTONE spot rate at award.

472
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,300
 Yeah. No, no. I'll just remove it. I'll just remove the comment.

473
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,300
 If you say that, he's going to go look at it. He's going to get on the website and go. There you go.

474
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:05,300
 Yeah, that's what I don't want to watch your conversation. I don't want to have to reprice the job every second day when it moves up and down 50 or 80 dollars or 100 bucks.

475
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:13,300
 Yes, I'm going to. I don't want I know what Peter's getting at. This guy's like that. That's what he's going to make me do every single time he thinks about the job.

476
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:20,300
 So take take Dale, take line item two out. Just just take it out.

477
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:32,300
 All right. I know I know what these people are talking about and it just becomes an exercise in futility.

478
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 All right.

479
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:52,300
 Price based on what you listed in appendix in attachment eight attachment three, which is fine. That's the 60 percent design.

480
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,300
 Yeah.

481
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:03,300
 The work plan is not considered very measurable. How do we lock that down? Like, yes, it's based off.

482
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
 Do you want that comment in there or not?

483
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:14,300
 Yes. Well, you asked me because this was my concern with the the square meters allowed.

484
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:24,300
 And when I read this, because when I spoke to you said, oh, is this subject to remeasure? And I said, oh, well, I could it could be subject to any of these blokes.

485
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,300
 And I didn't think you wanted to remeasure. And then the work quantity show.

486
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:35,300
 Then I read this because I hadn't read it before. The work quantity should be considered measurable.

487
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,300
 What do you what do you want to do? I don't have that comment in there. I generally don't. So I can take that out.

488
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,300
 Yeah. And I mean, you know, to be frank, your contract that we're signed is going to supersede that comment if it says something else.

489
00:36:48,300 --> 00:37:01,300
 So I can take that item. The problem I got is it is this Jamie will go through all this and he will want to see our answer to it or how we're going to manage it.

490
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:09,300
 So we'll take it. We'll take time. Five, five, five. Got it. Yeah.

491
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,300
 Miscellaneous flashing and sliding systems.

492
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,300
 Yeah, it's the bottom comment there that you've highlighted. Yeah.

493
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:25,300
 Just pay and see. So we've allowed for the flashings to waterproof our work. That's normal.

494
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:33,300
 What we're getting at is the K&C report doesn't talk about what happens to the flashings in a blast.

495
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:49,300
 So they're not allowed to rip off and hit anyone or do anything. And usually they become, you know, in a blast facade, they get designed up to be a stainless steel, you know, mechanically fixed, robust bit of flashing.

496
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,300
 But it's not required under the K&C report. And they don't talk about what they want to do there.

497
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:03,300
 That's why we're said we're not allowed for stainless steel or flashings like that, that in that area. Yeah. Maybe just tidy that up.

498
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,300
 Because, you know, when you just read it, that's an isolated line. We haven't allowed any stainless steel or any flashings.

499
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:17,300
 Or maybe we just remove stain. Maybe just get rid of the word or just say any stainless steel flashings because we've allowed for flashings on the job.

500
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:24,300
 Just not stainless steel. Yes. Yes. So, Dale, get rid of the word or and it just becomes stainless steel flashings.

501
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:31,300
 We haven't upspec them because at the moment they're just standard flashing galvanized zinc loom flashings that are underneath the cladding or whatever.

502
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:38,300
 But we've just not upspec it to stainless steel because it doesn't ask us to do it. No.

503
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:48,300
 But we just it's more of a making the K&C guys aware that they haven't considered that. But anyway.

504
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,300
 Yeah. What's your next one? Previously tested system. That's cool.

505
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:01,300
 Made that abundantly clear. We think we did, depending on who you talk to.

506
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:14,300
 Yeah. One thing for and it's more not that we'll probably have to lock away and get the acoustic engineer with any option to go.

507
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:21,300
 Yep. With what you're proposing, that is correct.

508
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,300
 So that way I understand any additional, you know, they turn around and say, oh, that's not good enough.

509
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,300
 So we'll need them to sign off. Yeah, look, that option is correct.

510
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,300
 The acoustic consultant is said, guys, you know, choose this class. It gets you an RW of 46 system 43.

511
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:52,300
 We're like, yeah, we'll follow that. Or and you need a 51. If he turns around and says, no, you need to I want you to make it a bit thicker.

512
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:59,300
 We're just saying, well, that's it. That's a material variation. Right. As far as we're concerned. And that'd be very actual to you guys as well.

513
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:07,300
 So I think for the jockey sass, isn't that what you came up with?

514
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,300
 Yeah, correct. Correct. Yeah. We're coming at that.

515
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:17,300
 Yeah. But I guess what we're trying to say is if he wants us to increase from that, do something else.

516
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,300
 It's very actual. That's what it will do. And I will achieve that 51 RW if he puts wants the jockey sass in there.

517
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,300
 If he decides I want it to be 53 RW for some reason, then I've got to thicken it.

518
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,300
 So it's my responsibility to achieve that RW value. My glass will do it.

519
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,300
 If I've got to change the glass for some reason to still achieve that number, that's still my responsibility.

520
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:47,300
 But if he changes those RW values, then and it requires any changes to the glass, it could be a variation.

521
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,300
 I mean, that's just a logical it's a logical comment.

522
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,300
 I know where is your 46 noted in you?

523
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,300
 It won't be in this. It won't be in this revision.

524
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:06,300
 No, because we'll change that to say 46 because the glass that we put in there is 40. It makes 46.

525
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:16,300
 Now, what you've got to do is you've got to have a make up for the 51. You've got to have a make up for the 46.

526
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,300
 Yep.

527
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,300
 And you've got to have a make up for the 35, the standard.

528
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,300
 Yep. So we'll break out H into the three.

529
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
 Yes.

530
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,300
 Yeah. Okay.

531
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
 The same as the pricing sheet.

532
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
 Yep. Yep.

533
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:40,300
 And what we'll do is we'll go back to the acoustic engineer and go, here's our proposed glass breakup as per yours.

534
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:47,300
 I think to close it off between us and the client and then go, here it is.

535
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,300
 They've reviewed it. The acoustic engineer is saying yes.

536
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:56,300
 And then from there, yeah, if they come back and change anyone for whatever reason, well, then it's like, hang on.

537
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,300
 We've actually had this reviewed and now they want to make a change.

538
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:09,300
 I think it's, yeah, this was more about flame for us. How do we make it more bulletproof for both of us?

539
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,300
 100%. You want that to marry the options above.

540
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
 Yes.

541
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
 That way, that's the detail. We'll do that.

542
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,300
 Yep.

543
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,300
 Cool.

544
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
 You got that, Dale?

545
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:29,300
 Yep.

546
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,300
 Yeah. So this is when, if you took the option of steel, I wasn't doing it.

547
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,300
 But when you go to aluminium, I'm supplying all the materials.

548
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,300
 Yeah. So I think we need to break that out as well.

549
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:54,300
 And yeah, we're allowed for an alternate FTO5 that is non-blast and it consists of X, Y and Z, obviously.

550
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,300
 So we go item 5F, so below E.

551
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
 Yeah.

552
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:06,300
 Optional item for us to supply the full system is an aluminium and we'll provide our own brackets and componentry.

553
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
 Yeah.

554
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,300
 Just for install.

555
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,300
 Yeah.

556
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,300
 Got it.

557
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,300
 Dale, you got that? Yeah?

558
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
 Yep.

559
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
 Perfect.

560
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
 Yeah, makes sense. I know what you're getting at.

561
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,300
 You guys know what we've priced, but we need to make it more clear to these guys if they read this.

562
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
 100%.

563
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,300
 That's right.

564
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,300
 Yeah.

565
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:37,300
 Protection that you've noted generally throughout the offer is that we will provide some, we won't provide any.

566
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:48,300
 We always provide tape on the mullions and we can put the 3M film on the outside of the glass that needs to be peeled off, but fine or clean if you want.

567
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
 Yes.

568
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,300
 Is that what you want?

569
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,300
 You need it.

570
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,300
 I think we need it.

571
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,300
 Yeah, do you need it? Generally you need it for dust and river and all that sort of stuff.

572
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
 The answer is yes.

573
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,300
 The answer is yes, we should put it on there.

574
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,300
 Every single job we put protection on there.

575
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,300
 Yeah, and you just need to clear that up and it's multiple points throughout.

576
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,300
 You're offered that, oh, we don't provide option, we don't provide protection.

577
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,300
 We will need it.

578
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
 It needs to be there.

579
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:36,300
 So item 14 stays in and we'll get rid of item 15 rising forward during the project.

580
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,300
 That item 15 that you've highlighted, it's locked in for the project.

581
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
 It's not again.

582
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,300
 Yeah, so remove that.

583
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,300
 That's just Dale trying to slip in something to see if you guys will pay for it.

584
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
 How much more of it is there?

585
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,300
 I think you're just blaming Dale.

586
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,300
 Let's fucking be honest here, buddy.

587
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:09,300
 I'd never throw you under a bus, Dale.

588
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,300
 Honestly, the biggest exclusion is the Mars stand.

589
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:24,300
 Understand that on the 60% it says it was on hold, but we need to price that.

590
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,300
 Yeah, well, the documents that we've got are just not clear enough to price.

591
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,300
 We want to do the works because we're there.

592
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,300
 We want to do as much works as we can because when you're on a job, that's the nature of it.

593
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,300
 But the Mars stuff, we just can't figure out what the hell it is.

594
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
 Just give us an estimate, Nathan, just a plug number.

595
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,300
 Just give us an indicative number that we can put below the line.

596
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,300
 It doesn't sit in your scope, but we can put it as part of the package.

597
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:55,300
 So we'll call it a provisional sum and we'll base it on a standard facade system.

598
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,300
 It'll be the same FTO1, you could assume.

599
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,300
 Yep.

600
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:07,300
 So we'll just put a rate next to that, call it a provisional sum, subject to design, and we'll put that in there for you.

601
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,300
 Dale, can you measure that, pop that in?

602
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,300
 Add it to the shopping list.

603
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
 To the shopping list, there we go.

604
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,300
 Yes, David, yep, we can do that.

605
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,300
 I've got the right pairs on an 80 square metre.

606
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,300
 Here we go.

607
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,300
 I'm never going to hear the end of that, right to the end of the project.

608
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,300
 That's just going to keep coming up.

609
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
 Yep.

610
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,300
 So I'm glad we established that.

611
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,300
 Yeah.

612
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:58,300
 The doors, this is something we tossed and turned about, like whether you guys should look at doing all the, any glazed doors so that it's in the same system around the building.

613
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:11,300
 Obviously, you know, timber doors or whatever are glazed, but whether you're just looking at doing all the glazed doors.

614
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:18,300
 Okay, so we know if they're glazed, Dale, you and I had this conversation, I wasn't sure what they were.

615
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:27,300
 Yeah, there are some glazed doors and there's some that are.

616
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,300
 Right.

617
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,300
 I've lost you.

618
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,300
 You there.

619
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,300
 You're breaking up my sorry, I can't hear you.

620
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:48,300
 Must be planes going over.

621
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,300
 I'm like.

622
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,300
 No.

623
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:02,300
 Lost you.

624
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,300
 Not bad Lawson's trying to get in now.

625
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
 Hey Ben.

626
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,300
 Yeah.

627
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,300
 Lost you.

628
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,300
 Yeah.

629
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:26,300
 Sorry, yeah, yeah, our internet here is died.

630
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,300
 Okay, so I can still bring up, it just won't be up on the screen.

631
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,300
 Is my computer.

632
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,300
 Just give us the item numbers that you're going through.

633
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,300
 Yeah, I've got the document open.

634
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,300
 So we're up to page.

635
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,300
 Well, you're up to exclusions master and we talked about.

636
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,300
 Number 19.

637
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:16,300
 I think it's going to be some sort of flashing where you come into cladding and, and the like.

638
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:26,300
 Yeah.

639
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,300
 Yeah.

640
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:46,300
 Yeah.

641
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:58,300
 Yeah.

642
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:17,300
 Yeah.

643
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:28,300
 Yeah.

644
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
 Yeah.

645
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,300
 I've got a waterproof it.

646
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,300
 You've got a waterproof.

647
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,300
 Yeah.

648
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,300
 Right.

649
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,300
 I've got a flashing at an angle so I'll just elaborate on that and say flashings to our works is included.

650
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,300
 Yeah.

651
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:47,300
 Yeah.

652
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,300
 Yeah.

653
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
 Yeah.

654
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,300
 Next one is our number 22.

655
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,300
 Right.

656
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,300
 Each.

657
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,300
 So we'll elaborate.

658
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,300
 We allow for my installation.

659
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,300
 I just need wherever you're moving my palates around like where you jump them over to the air.

660
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,340
 around like where you jump them over to the air side for me so I can you know or

661
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,540
 if I like if you're putting them up onto a floor I need you to lift them to

662
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,660
 wherever they need to go but any installation craniage is by me so I'll

663
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,620
 just say instant on the back of that installation craniage by myself but if

664
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,420
 you we need to look at how it's you wouldn't you look after your own

665
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,100
 materials handling no yeah Nathan yeah of course around the floors I'll do that

666
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,600
 what about on the side what if it turns up on a truck and gets unloaded with a

667
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:40,980
 minute ooh and it's got to be moved 50 times what does it need to be moved 50

668
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,839
 times I'm just asking all right the pallets are sick so you and this is

669
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:52,020
 probably more for Dale or for Ben stage one the packs will be labeled 1 to 20

670
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,259
 and we'll have a layout that shows where they need to go on the floor they go to

671
00:51:56,259 --> 00:52:01,600
 that spot I installed out from there and they don't I mean these things are you

672
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,540
 know massive right and they're massive pallets you know why can't you take them

673
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,560
 off the semi and put them where you need them so well the only provides vertical

674
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,460
 lift yeah that's all I need vertical lift all I need is vertical it movement

675
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,299
 around the floors is by me I'll move it around the floor so if I can come

676
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:22,420
 straight off the street and move it to a location on the building where I need to

677
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,259
 and I've got access to do so on trolleys I'll do that or with a walkie reach not

678
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,020
 a problem but um if it needs to be craned somewhere like you know somewhere

679
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,100
 obscure I'm just saying you a vertical lift you guys need to help me out with

680
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,820
 that because I don't have needs to be unloaded off the semi because there's no

681
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:48,140
 crane here and taken around to the northern facade yeah main wall is on our

682
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:55,180
 land side delineation you can do that the land side so you're a manager was

683
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,140
 there's an all-out stuff yeah yes that's what we're asking that's what we're

684
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,379
 talking about yeah you can unload your own semi and move it around but you're

685
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:06,379
 just not going to crane it to a position up to a floor of an industry craned up

686
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:14,580
 yeah got it so early discussions Nathan was that you were gonna lift from the

687
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:19,140
 ground floor yeah so that's correct so if we're looking from the ground floor

688
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,779
 then vertical lifting is not really going to be an issue right sure so is

689
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:33,940
 that still the strategy yes so you'll have you'll have your mate or whatever

690
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,060
 up on the first floor and you because that's what we talked about how very

691
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,980
 early on I think with Warwick how we were gonna get these panels up and how

692
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,780
 he was gonna get them up through that ceiling and all that sort of shit yeah

693
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,060
 yeah okay so so do you want me to change that to

694
00:53:51,060 --> 00:54:00,259
 just say vertical cranium so we've got to be careful here because we we have

695
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:06,620
 as part of the I've been certain bits of cranium certainly not for facade right

696
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:16,460
 so we said trade cost it that cranium for windows and lazy is a trade cost

697
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:25,420
 yeah okay well that's all right we should we should need anyone and and to

698
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:33,580
 you to unloading their own trucks I take it you can't somewhere oh yeah

699
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,820
 not near size we've got our own holding facility we'll pull everything out of

700
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,780
 the containers we generally store okay because we're doing it in stages it's a

701
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,460
 bit different but if it's a typical building we'd still probably two floors

702
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,500
 in advance unpacked ready to go at any given moment and then we'll just try and

703
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,820
 get well in this case we'll have a stage being loaded ahead of us as we start to

704
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:00,620
 install yeah but again you're going to manage to with slippers or whatever you

705
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:07,700
 need to get the material to where you need it to crane so yes I can put my

706
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,100
 head around yet I've got an access budget that I can accommodate that but I

707
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,060
 wonder if you're gonna have a manner to and I have a driver with that work

708
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,660
 because you're gonna have something on side I'll be tied up it'll be tied up

709
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,940
 it's about it's a bit of a result and how big how big we need it what yeah I

710
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,220
 don't know whether we've worked all that it's not a normal manner to this

711
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,940
 probably you'll need it you'll need a six-ton manner to if what is what I

712
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,060
 suspect to pick up your pallets with slippers there won't won't be a standard

713
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,580
 three-ton manner to that these cars have had buzzing around everywhere yeah

714
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,180
 that's okay we've got jobs where we allow for that that's fine we've got a

715
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:52,100
 we've got an access allowance for that sort of thing so that's all right it's

716
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,020
 just the vertical lifting thing I just don't have a crane if I've got to lift

717
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,140
 something because I can't get access just I can't get access onto the first

718
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,980
 floor we've got a little bit of everything that's that's what that's

719
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,259
 about

720
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:21,460
 I've played frozen in you there guys then yeah like frozen again yeah you

721
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,420
 know that's bad there boys

722
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:31,780
 we all know where to stop that happens

723
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,500
 it is

724
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:49,140
 you guys want to read all back in

725
00:56:49,140 --> 00:57:02,220
 yeah yeah all right I think so so we've got a we've got to make sure yeah we

726
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,540
 can't

727
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:20,980
 yeah look at the end of the day there shouldn't be any vertical lifting here

728
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:27,060
 we go you guys there what's that

729
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:35,020
 get back

730
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:47,060
 bells back here we go yeah so we're talking about on the western facade

731
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,900
 will be that'll be an issue the windows are up above the old above the terminal

732
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,820
 roof there we'll end up having to come up with a solution to get those windows

733
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:06,980
 up yeah and that's Nathan getting his own crane I can do it with my Ada yes

734
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:14,820
 yeah if I need a 50 ton crane to do something I have an alley out for it we

735
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:20,020
 need we need to sit down and go through that then Nathan yeah yeah and the

736
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:26,820
 lifting and because it's a great cost and we can either was that what a budget

737
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:33,460
 towards it yeah yep right

738
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,500
 master king that's a lot thermal assessment so we of course do our own

739
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,460
 internal thermal assessment and we give the the calculations for that that says

740
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,540
 we meet the requirements for JV 3 and section J and all that sort of stuff

741
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:55,980
 yeah yeah so we can elaborate on that say like you know we don't do the

742
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,420
 overall assessment for everyone we just do the facade assessment say we're

743
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:04,259
 compliant and here's the calculations for that so do you just want us to put

744
00:59:04,259 --> 00:59:08,660
 some words behind that to make it a bit more clearer well because is that under

745
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:14,940
 an exclusion yes you can't just say thermal assessment excluded it's it's

746
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:23,100
 so so just right that I'd say just remove the 24 completely because it's a

747
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,140
 requirement under the contract that we do our own thermal assessment so just

748
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,980
 remove it and we don't have to elaborate because it's a we have to do structural

749
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:37,180
 thermal and acoustics and it sounds like we'll be doing some sort of blast study

750
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:47,740
 as well so remove that yeah yeah yeah and fp 1.4 as well is another one for

751
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:54,540
 the water tightness yeah so we we provide all the documentation for 1.4 to

752
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,899
 help their engineer that does it we've done it all we all know where to do it

753
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:07,580
 now so that's not a problem yep yeah yeah we need to be final back and do

754
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:13,340
 that um get rid of 25 you've heard that's that's in in the that's detail in

755
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,740
 the inclusions yeah well describe with it inclusions but yeah I can move 25 not

756
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:26,820
 a problem get rid of it yeah value is in screen so you're gonna have to provide

757
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:34,300
 your own what's that for exclusion zones exclusion sites that's more like you

758
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,740
 know I'm not putting a fence around the facade to stop people from touching it

759
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:43,100
 but as in you know sectioning off an area that people can't get into while

760
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,900
 I'm installing definitely I have to do that yes so would you like me to just

761
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:56,540
 elaborate you know we barrier screens comma we do allow for exclusion zones

762
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:05,100
 for our works so so so no no other barriers apart from exclusion I guess

763
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:12,779
 I'll remove the comment take 26 out there yeah now the documentation that we

764
01:01:12,779 --> 01:01:17,020
 have Dale doesn't ask for bin modeling

765
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:28,100
 that's why we've got 27 highlighted in there that Dale yep no I'm not the not

766
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:42,100
 TV they stand up have you got me you bet yeah yeah we need a triple check whether

767
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:48,779
 we do need to provide BIM because I know for everything else we are required

768
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:52,740
 that's why I highlighted it that's something that we'll have to come back

769
01:01:52,740 --> 01:02:02,420
 to you we know there's no mention in the facade spec that is a requirement and it

770
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,860
 might be in the architectural spec but I think I think we even went through that

771
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:14,100
 Dale do you want to double check the architect a spare a day out now we'll

772
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,020
 double check it but the reason why we put that in there is that we couldn't

773
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:22,180
 find anywhere that requires BIM modeling and look it's these days it's some do

774
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:28,180
 some don't yeah we'll just double check it but we're pretty sure it's not

775
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:41,740
 required on the job yes 31 what's light stops reveals like if you you know wanted

776
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:47,100
 to put integrated lighting around the blinds into like you know the pelmets or

777
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,899
 something like that you know some sort of you know wanky thing we're not we're

778
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:57,020
 not doing internal finish trades against our works for lights or reveals or

779
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:04,259
 anything like that internal partitions part petition to you know I got I had a

780
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:09,660
 tender recently that we picked up in Newcastle just up the road and that we

781
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,259
 now almost finished and because I didn't detail this stuff out the guys like well

782
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:18,060
 why aren't you doing the mirrors in the bathrooms I said to him what do you want

783
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:23,740
 me to put the mirrors in my exclusions he's like yeah well it's glass I'm like

784
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:30,100
 that's are you kidding me so now we've got these big lists because anyway

785
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:35,620
 protection yeah there's none of that in your documentation none of that in the

786
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:41,299
 architectural there's no straight anywhere that's it protection after

787
01:03:41,299 --> 01:03:44,819
 installation is excluded other than the prescribed protection as factory applied

788
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:50,379
 so we put the tape on we cut the glass in a protective film I don't that's it I

789
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:57,220
 don't do anything else yeah I can put a bathroom nursing I mean I'd like to put

790
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:01,060
 a electric charge through the facade to stop people from touching it but I can't

791
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:11,380
 it's not sensible electric strikes we may need the provision like everywhere

792
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:18,300
 because it airport will have provision for security so on so forth not to

793
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,780
 provide the electric strikes but provision for them like the cutouts oh

794
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,220
 the cutouts are not an issue we can put that that's an easy that cutouts are not

795
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:32,460
 a problem but electric strikes themselves you know yeah that would be

796
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:39,180
 why the contract it's just the cutouts that we need to all there for same as

797
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:47,700
 number 37 the penetrations for security cameras lighting signage etc we're gonna

798
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:55,419
 have them potentially everywhere but that that's gonna be because that's not

799
01:04:55,419 --> 01:04:58,339
 detailed in any of the documents there is why this that we've got this here is

800
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:01,419
 it's not detailed anywhere and as far as we're concerned to you and I it's a

801
01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:06,020
 variation because it's not detailed there's no sprinkler penetrations not

802
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,740
 security camera lighting signage they haven't put told us where they want I'm

803
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:14,700
 sure there's gonna be a big friggin sign somewhere but they haven't detailed it

804
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,540
 so it you know how big is it you know how many if there's two I don't care is

805
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,939
 there 50 cameras or 100 cameras like you know starts to become a big job you know

806
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:30,220
 down the track so I think that has to stay in there until it's the architect

807
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:39,939
 documents it Nathan's speaking of the electric strikes we didn't find any

808
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:46,140
 doors other than the entry door in this job yeah that's correct yeah I thought

809
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,340
 so

810
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,420
 either dial

811
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:04,940
 one again I like we're we're struggling here have you got us yeah yeah yeah did

812
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:10,060
 you get that did you get it did you get it yeah that yeah I'm gonna pick the

813
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:14,500
 exact words our clients gonna say to us is that a competent builder would have

814
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:19,500
 allowed for an appropriate amount of penetrations for security cameras you

815
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:29,220
 know it's gonna be somewhere and tell us that that is all our problem but I'm not

816
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,700
 a security camera expert here do I know how many cameras you bought in the

817
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,740
 building how many like you want to a hundred I'll do whatever you want but no

818
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,740
 one's you know the architect should be somebody needs to be documenting that

819
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:48,460
 and then I can and I will say that'll come at a hundred percent documentation

820
01:06:48,460 --> 01:07:01,620
 not at 60 just yeah yeah do you want me to give you a cost per hole

821
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:07,380
 a cost per hole you know and then you guys can just take a punt on how many

822
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,819
 holes you think we need to put around the place I mean really you're not

823
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,740
 putting now just in me out a second you're not putting these through the

824
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:17,339
 mullions where on the facade are these gonna go they're gonna be hanging off

825
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:20,380
 something but you know you can't drill into the mullions because that's a

826
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:29,540
 pressure equalized system so you know is it an issue really for the facade I

827
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:34,900
 wouldn't have thought so did you don't you don't like I've never put us I've

828
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,500
 never done it to a mullion before

829
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,779
 no

830
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,540
 you're not gonna be putting it through the glass

831
01:07:50,540 --> 01:08:03,380
 don't tell you that given I actually had a actually had a foreman drill a hole in

832
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:13,180
 glass to put a damn pipe through and a sprinkler pipe he didn't last the day he

833
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:25,059
 didn't die I see you're a fucking idiot I wouldn't fit above anyway it went to

834
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:29,700
 all that trouble to have the bloke got a hole in the glass yeah well I'll tell

835
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:40,300
 you what you're there dad yes did you hear what I said about the penetrations

836
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,900
 yeah yeah yeah I still think we're gonna have to give me a right for a hole up to

837
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:52,300
 25 mil and we're just gonna have to add a pretty good pride reserve in there but

838
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,779
 for that that's what I'm saying yeah okay

839
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:04,100
 Dale Dale in the underneath including in the provisional sum a cost per hole for

840
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:09,660
 25 millimeter diamond it'll be bigger than 25 mil won't it be like 50 mil

841
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:16,340
 right with a sleeve or something up to 50 mil up to 50 mil and I'll give you

842
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:24,899
 we've got a whole that we use on artics yeah yeah yeah okay just a recent tender

843
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:33,660
 we we're working on now we we will need to do on-site and leakage testing and

844
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:38,500
 acoustic testing you know understand it it won't be provided for you guys but we

845
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:45,220
 have a green the green star requirements to do that yep so I mean we can be there

846
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:50,580
 when you do it yeah you know that's not a problem we don't organize it no no no

847
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:57,860
 no we will just need probably someone there from yours yeah Dale come down and

848
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:05,460
 do it not a problem with his cork and gun make sure there's no leaks yep not a

849
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,820
 problem we just don't we just don't you know we're not we're not the guys that

850
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,020
 do it that's all we'll just be there if any if you need us to do something we're

851
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:21,380
 around yes yep no I agree we just need my way that we do have to provide it and

852
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,260
 that you guys will probably need some attendance there will need attendance

853
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:37,340
 there yep spotters if you need them you need to provide them you only got

854
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,780
 exclusion zones or spotters one or the other well we use exclusion zones there

855
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:48,260
 might be some situations I'm thinking on the north facade over where the airside

856
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:53,820
 where you might need to have the spotter in place instead of an exclusion zone

857
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:59,420
 there might be some what what area is that but whoever's whoever's downstairs

858
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:04,860
 rigging up the you know panel is a spot on that one's gonna be a spot or anyway

859
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,179
 yeah he's gonna be working from the ground it's not a toilet in the ground

860
01:11:08,179 --> 01:11:12,620
 so you'll be there you'll be down there so we'll take the comment out yeah

861
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:16,740
 that's it that's a very valid point we've got a guy standing there bringing

862
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:21,460
 up the panels in in the exclusion area watching them go in so take out 43 Dale

863
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:26,340
 because it's it's this is this is more for when you're doing tall towers yeah

864
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,180
 yeah I don't have a guy standing there for six months of installation on it on

865
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:43,020
 the 43rd floor you know and he's on the ground so yeah take out 43 yep I get why

866
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,660
 they needed but you're paying a guy 150 grand a year to stand there with his

867
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:51,460
 palms folded eight hours a day doing for

868
01:11:52,660 --> 01:12:00,660
 so back before we go to design if a glass panel breaks Nathan and it's under

869
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:09,500
 warranty TFG will remove the panel and install it yes I was talking through

870
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,860
 that so they've had issues in my past life

871
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:20,980
 no it's a sneaky software inclusion yeah so if if I'm like a fun I've got my

872
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:28,179
 insurances cover me all my works from manufacturing all the way through to

873
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:33,299
 install and hand over and those insurances that you make me take out

874
01:12:33,299 --> 01:12:37,780
 cover the cost if I break a piece in transit on the ocean I've got marine

875
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:41,179
 freight insurance I've got all that sort of stuff a bit in the yard get suck my

876
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,940
 fixer breaks it my that's what you make me have these insurances for right I've

877
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:50,060
 got ten glass replacements in King Street Newcastle at the moment and I'm

878
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:53,940
 you know 120 grand's worth of glass replacements and I'm getting the

879
01:12:53,940 --> 01:13:00,820
 insurer to pay for it what I don't cover is if the idiot that's doing the internal

880
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:07,820
 ceiling aluminium sheet drives his forklift into a piece of glass and

881
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:12,660
 breaks it then I expect him to pay completely agree completely agree that

882
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:17,740
 white questions about in three months time we turn up we get a phone call that

883
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,500
 the airport says all this glass is popped and so it's up the top well

884
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:29,099
 that's that's if it's a defect or a warranty issue I've got to cover it if

885
01:13:29,099 --> 01:13:33,900
 it's spontaneous break spontaneous break is due to nickel sulfide inclusion and

886
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:38,460
 I've done my due diligence improving certificates for it it's not my cost

887
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:43,660
 because no no glass supplier warrants nickel sulfide inclusions and that's a

888
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:51,660
 really hard one to argue however however how many times in the last you know

889
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,740
 several years of I had this happen I haven't I know other people have been

890
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:00,620
 they shit the glass suppliers out of China and that's why it does happen

891
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:07,740
 yeah so that's so there's a panel busted and we can attribute that it's a TFG

892
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:13,140
 issue TFG will will remove the panel that's there and replace it they won't

893
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:16,420
 just send on a shipping container and say it's all that no no replacement the

894
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:22,420
 the replacement cost is by my glass supplier and the labor cost is by me if

895
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:28,580
 if it's a glass fabricator issue and on this particular job we're using probably

896
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:32,940
 the second largest glass supplier in the world to do this job so we've gone to

897
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:37,900
 reputable guys if they do have an issue I'd be dragging them down and saying you

898
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,780
 pay for the whole thing guys anyway I'd be hitting them on the head because I

899
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:45,780
 you know expect them to care about their product but again I have a warranty

900
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:54,019
 provision and my costings that I put aside for things like that yeah I

901
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:59,700
 actually and I have to say this I don't think a lot of facade guys I compete

902
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:06,180
 against have put together a warranty fund that they bank money aside it was

903
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:10,620
 something that we did at Permis de Liza over the years every single job we have

904
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:15,180
 a warranty bank account that you put money aside and I don't think any people

905
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:24,540
 anyone does that in the industry I don't think they do anyway

906
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:40,740
 5.1.1 understand that you get all the data given to you, here's the wind loads, here's everything, here's the specification

907
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:48,580
 blah blah blah and then you've done to take no checking. So we read it but so

908
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:53,380
 just explain let me explain that one to you yeah inhabit give me a set of like a

909
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:58,019
 good one is the section J report right says I've got to have a U-value of this

910
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:04,300
 an SHGC and R-value of that I read that I go and do my design on my system and

911
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,540
 then they come back and say oh we fucked up actually it's got to change well I'm

912
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:13,260
 not checking that data for you to for its suitability I'm just following the

913
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:18,140
 documents that your client is providing me if I'm smart I've been here a long

914
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,740
 time my guys are smart if they do see something they'll flag it they'll take

915
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:25,820
 all due skill and care if they see something that doesn't seem right but

916
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,180
 I'm not responsible for inhabits document that's his document he's

917
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:33,700
 insured with his PI for that document and I'm not going to check his document

918
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,260
 and say you know I'm not gonna it doesn't become my his document doesn't

919
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,780
 become my responsibility it's suitable for the job and Cox is

920
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:45,660
 deemed to be so and so as inhabit and so as an Apple right yeah I think I think

921
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:50,340
 you from it if that if there was something in what you just touched on

922
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:57,180
 if there's something that you got this looks just obviously wrong let's flag it

923
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:03,260
 that would be expectation that you flagged something but you don't own it

924
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:07,980
 yeah I'll elaborate on that comment and say we'll take all skill and care that

925
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:14,740
 you'd expect from a specialist contractor to vet documents and highlight

926
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:19,580
 anything if we find it so I'm happy to put that in there I'm just happy yeah

927
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:25,860
 yeah you don't take ultimate responsibility and wait for the agree

928
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:32,700
 but yeah there is something you go hang on that is completely fucking well

929
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:37,860
 yeah that looks completely wrong to us well look at the 10th the stuff we've

930
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,099
 raised during the tender documents you know we've raised a lot of stuff that

931
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:45,380
 doesn't make sense or you know needs further discussion and we do that

932
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:50,380
 naturally because that's what you have is for but again it's it's not you know

933
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:55,740
 I don't determine those numbers that would give them that that's right but

934
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:02,900
 yeah if you can sort of clear that up that you yep we not check it but we like

935
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,820
 anything it's better totally no we'll fly we'll flag things using all skill

936
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,019
 and skill and care so she had with our trade yep and not a problem

937
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:19,219
 yeah I'll put that in there we obviously we do have ASD requirements in the

938
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:27,660
 green star requirements we just need to make sure barely given you everything

939
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:34,820
 but so so what that and these things are really hard to write on the ESD so we do

940
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:39,460
 everything that you're asking to in the in the in the specs we give you all the

941
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:45,260
 data all the engineering but you're not yours because it's not yours it Cox are

942
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:48,460
 gonna collate all that information to get their green star rating we're saying

943
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:53,220
 I don't get you the green star rating I just follow yeah yeah you know and I

944
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:56,820
 insist by giving you this information because it's in the contract to do so

945
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:02,340
 but I'm not you know I'm not going to actually get the green star rating for

946
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:12,220
 you yep we just need to make sure that we've given you all the information so

947
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:19,500
 that guys the green star stuff I'm pretty sure we've seen yeah cool

948
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:27,380
 there's only 70 more pages to go you're supposed to get through oh you're

949
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:33,500
 getting through the yeah everything you're almost there yeah we are

950
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:45,140
 PC day June 24th and you sent us an email about this offer was based on a

951
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:51,700
 date that's now bucket baby go on all right I'll get my time machine go back

952
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:56,700
 and start three weeks ago what do you want us to do that you just you just

953
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:04,380
 fattened it out yours it was fat anyway sorry your time your timing was fat

954
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,740
 anyway

955
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:21,019
 yeah what are we gonna do there what are we gonna do yeah well we could put

956
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:31,740
 program to be agreed when we we we don't actually have an agree well we have a

957
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:39,860
 contract program that's now relevant Ben's been doing the updating it with

958
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:45,580
 all everybody's you know times in there where did you get we talked about it

959
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:58,980
 earlier been where we'll you know so but that's okay we I think just do what you

960
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:05,180
 said Peter we take the date out of yeah everything's a program to be agreed and

961
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:09,980
 yes that allows you guys the freedom to discuss your end what you'd need to do

962
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,059
 and you've got our program anyway and you can move that Ben Lawson around

963
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:20,220
 yeah so we can put a note in there that that that it's based based on your

964
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:26,380
 duration for design manufacture and install and triggers upon award and

965
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:31,860
 wherever that fits within the program when it yeah yeah so I think but I think

966
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:36,620
 you're right the first comment you made which makes it very easy is we just say

967
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:42,460
 program to be agreed yeah yeah so take it the PC day and take out the award

968
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:49,300
 date and say program to be agreed yeah yeah and we'll make our own comments in

969
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:55,820
 relation to how we how we do that we so all we can say that you know the the

970
01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:02,020
 the duration is based on this program you know the the TFG program it says

971
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:08,820
 from letter of intent to completion is X amount of months yep you got that Dale

972
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:16,860
 that's our TFG Dale yep all right do you want to bring back up the the program

973
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:23,219
 thing I can't read that up up there Ben so so that's one big pinch in what

974
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:30,540
 we're saying is the structure still sign off ready for the roof is on the 4th of

975
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:37,299
 the 624 that's working off the current design programs we've got and the EFN

976
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:45,020
 program yep Nathan's intending to have the whole project finished on the 14th

977
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:49,140
 of the fifth so three weeks earlier it doesn't work

978
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:55,020
 though so it's gonna move but that's okay what I'm more concerned about is if

979
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,260
 you push the facade into Chinese New Year then I end up yeah well we're

980
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:03,740
 already starting to push into it actually so it's too late now yeah but

981
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,780
 that's only a couple of weeks yeah it's only a couple of weeks at the moment

982
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,259
 but what happens if these guys settle this for another month that's my

983
01:23:09,259 --> 01:23:12,380
 concern yeah but sorry the the new the Chinese

984
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:17,099
 is only a couple of weeks that sat down for a month is it we hit China New Year

985
01:23:17,099 --> 01:23:21,580
 in Songkran so we lose three weeks between January and April so one week in

986
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,860
 Thailand and two weeks in China

987
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:34,500
 well that's a shower well China's the glass times the glass and

988
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:40,020
 Thailand's for the production of the assembly of panels so so you don't

989
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,660
 sight-measure your frames as you're making them do you?

990
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:47,100
 hell no we go off the we go off the drawings that are issued for

991
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:55,420
 construction that we design so your glass I mean yeah so yeah that's why I

992
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:01,860
 think you know just say they let the job and then say it's the next week I with

993
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:06,219
 your steel issues I think we're okay they let it in two or three weeks and

994
01:24:06,219 --> 01:24:11,700
 we've absorbed your steel delay that's why I think Ben Lawson's

995
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,099
 going to come to that conclusion when he reads that program yeah yeah I've

996
01:24:16,099 --> 01:24:24,339
 integrated your program into us now so sorry sorry again I've integrated your

997
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:33,220
 program into our program it's now inserted completely how long can you

998
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:44,340
 hold the glass for? You know if our dates don't line up but we want to order and get

999
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:48,940
 things underway to miss Chinese New Year. If we're storing that look I'd deliver it to

1000
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:54,860
 Australia I wouldn't hold it overseas you want it in the country you want it

1001
01:24:54,860 --> 01:25:02,460
 up the road and you know like Dale I think from memory to store you know you

1002
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:07,299
 know what would be considered you know probably a couple of stages of the job

1003
01:25:07,299 --> 01:25:11,740
 like two stages would probably be around four or five grand a month or something

1004
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:15,580
 like that in costs is that about right Dale how we we did the exercise the

1005
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:19,860
 other day so just say for some reason the steel's delayed by two months your

1006
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:26,580
 storage costs you might pay 10 grand you know 15 tops you know is that is that a

1007
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:31,940
 bad thing no I'd rather have it here and be storing it and ready to just pump it

1008
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:35,420
 in I mean and as Warwick said if the steel just say by chance the steel flies

1009
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:40,059
 in pretty well once you started you know if we could have multiple crews and

1010
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:50,260
 you've got a lot of product great then do it yeah so we yeah so yeah you will

1011
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:57,580
 pull part five grand a month if we need to so as I've highlighted it that we're

1012
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,820
 all talking about us getting there early the panel I'm deeply concerned how we're

1013
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:03,860
 going to go through the design process with this architect and getting them to

1014
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:09,340
 complete the defacing details with us per stage per Ben Lawson's program I

1015
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:13,180
 think they're gonna fuck it up and we're gonna lose those few weeks that we've

1016
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:18,340
 got up our sleeve I did I'm a hundred percent um that's you know my crystal

1017
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:26,420
 ball for the job so you know but have a look at eight weeks you guys have been

1018
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,700
 pushing like hell to get this tender over the line they've been dragging

1019
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:34,180
 their feet and can't even decide what they want for lunch and I still don't

1020
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,820
 think it's going to be another two weeks and I'm not taking up Peters mantra but

1021
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:41,820
 imagine this when we're trying to do the design and getting them a decision in

1022
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:48,820
 workshops these are right but at the end of the day that their only job is to

1023
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:55,700
 review the shop drawings I can just fuck like what are they gonna do yeah but you

1024
01:26:55,700 --> 01:27:00,480
 know you I get the feeling these guys are gonna circle every single day how

1025
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,820
 we put 300 and start asking stupid questions yeah that's what's gonna

1026
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:09,179
 happen I got stupid questions I'm gonna spin around and we'll be up to revision

1027
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:14,660
 three on drawings and arguing with them why are you asking us these questions on

1028
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:20,019
 how this works well the client the client Nelly is is of the view that this

1029
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:27,740
 becomes a DNC yeah we could exclude them totally

1030
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:34,900
 hmm I'll let you have that argument Peter no no I'm happy to have that yep

1031
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:41,460
 anyway this is stuff that we've got a night and you know we will make it

1032
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,980
 clear in our recommendation that that you know all this is subject to you know

1033
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:52,860
 your consultants mr. client fucking before me so well Neil Kendrick's look

1034
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:58,019
 and that's why I said to you out of the meeting Neil Kendrick from inhabit he'll

1035
01:27:58,019 --> 01:28:02,380
 he'll keep up pace with us and you know he's the sort of guy we can call prior

1036
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,660
 to things happening saying this is what we're gonna do we'll warm him up to it

1037
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:09,820
 so it just flies through his side he won't be the issue on this project I

1038
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:12,179
 don't feel

1039
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:23,460
 anyway um Dale do you want to go on to the next one yeah number 11 entire

1040
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:35,300
 floors to be clear yeah that's that's a war playing on just how this job is so

1041
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:40,140
 fuck off Warwick you know what do you mean you don't you don't roll up the

1042
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:44,820
 red carpet and get get the floor beautifully cleaned and spotless for us

1043
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:51,060
 now you're gonna a nice clear little landing strip and that's it yeah fair

1044
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:57,700
 enough all right can we just need an area to store what we'll do is we'll

1045
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:04,060
 give you a we'll give you an area yeah well you just got a bit you know like

1046
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:08,540
 that you'll give me an area hold on let me let me just have an exclusion zone

1047
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:13,940
 probably you know what three meters from the facade yep and we can just put a

1048
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:18,820
 pallet the pallet water right around the perimeter yeah yep okay so we'll change

1049
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:24,460
 that comment to just say we just need enough area to store our pallets in a

1050
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:29,940
 sequence so I just need to be very very very clear following Ben Lawson's

1051
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:35,940
 program these packs are going to be specifically packed and identified than

1052
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:42,339
 the stages and areas that we're installing so I'm not gonna move them

1053
01:29:42,339 --> 01:29:45,540
 over to the other side of the building because there's enough room in stage one

1054
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:50,299
 or stage four they go in the stage area I'm gonna work and that's where they

1055
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:57,900
 need to live while I'm installing and then I leave yeah yep yep

1056
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:05,980
 is the site manager in this meeting I just want to see if he heard heard that

1057
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:12,900
 yeah all right anyway we can change that comment to just say we just need

1058
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:19,500
 adequate space for our pallets to be in the areas they're assigned to yeah you

1059
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:26,420
 got that Dale yeah can you put that in yep yeah we talked about vertical

1060
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:32,540
 lifting we might just need to work out how many lifts we'll get rid of that

1061
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:36,260
 we've already talked about that so 12 comes out you keep repeating yourselves

1062
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,460
 we like to do that say it's hard builders are harder hearing so we'd

1063
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:45,620
 like to repeat stop repeating ourselves provides efficient site crane usage to

1064
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:53,420
 ensure get rid of 12 or 13 are out yep it's fine 12 and 13 out I agree

1065
01:30:53,420 --> 01:31:03,940
 yep there's inevitably gonna be a little bit of movement it's not gonna be

1066
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:11,740
 perfect every the thing is even on 14 well 15 15 Z comes out because you've

1067
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:15,020
 got the manitou with the tines and you can move them wherever he needs to yeah

1068
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:21,660
 number 15 is to do with we're following Ben's sequence staging if all

1069
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:26,820
 of a sudden you say to me go to stage three I'll do what I can but I wouldn't

1070
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,860
 have designed procured and manufactured in that sequence I probably won't have

1071
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:35,220
 the material so we've got to strictly follow this staging yeah that's okay you

1072
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:39,780
 know we'll just find Ben then yeah so that's why I'm mentioning Ben we're

1073
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:45,380
 gonna follow that to the letter and we can't really change it because it's it's

1074
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:49,500
 it's it's not like we've got we're doing floor by floor we've got areas and

1075
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,380
 interfaces and everything we're gonna have materials you know if we have to

1076
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,980
 move areas and this is actually quite important for the site guys if you if we

1077
01:31:56,980 --> 01:32:00,260
 have to move areas we're gonna end up opening packs having things are under

1078
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:03,700
 half done it's a lot of material that's going to be there per stage because it's

1079
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,940
 not working in a floor it's working in a stage which has got a lot more to it

1080
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:15,260
 yeah Nathan the steel is going that stage and the roof is going that stage

1081
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:21,100
 yeah so you will be fine it's not it's not for you the comment it's for the

1082
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:27,900
 site team that's building it follows your program properly yeah I'll be doing

1083
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:33,020
 I'll be doing part of my job is to do regular checks and and assistance with

1084
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:39,580
 what's going what's coming forward why am I driving yeah yeah okay all right

1085
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:47,780
 what's the next one I am free of other trade yeah but seven and eight once

1086
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:56,260
 again don't worry fuck off you know you can only dream right yeah okay so number

1087
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:03,100
 seven and eight sufficient site claims again fuck be dead yeah well every time

1088
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:21,140
 you're gonna say crime Dale Lordy Dale all right get rid of them seven seven

1089
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:27,700
 eight happy to take out what's this fucking thing one trade claim on a

1090
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:36,820
 double-handling it's gonna be inevitable that we're gonna have to pull something

1091
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:40,700
 well he's gonna he's gonna take it off his truck and put it on the ground in

1092
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:45,260
 in the open area yeah then then he's gonna put it on back on the tines and

1093
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:52,820
 drive it round and then I'll move it to my areas and I'll move around within my

1094
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:57,260
 areas to do my works but you know if there's this requirement I got to move

1095
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,660
 it across the other side of the building for some reason that's double handling

1096
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:07,460
 for me I'm like why am I doing that you know if it's at my fault okay fine you

1097
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,660
 know but if for some reason you want to get into the stage and do some out of

1098
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:15,060
 sequence works there for some reason I've got to stop and move materials

1099
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:20,540
 around my my guys on site and this is a real problem with installers these days

1100
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:23,700
 they just charge start charging they start hitting the clock going well on a

1101
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:28,420
 second that's not you know that's not our cost so this is not me this is my

1102
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:31,540
 cyclist

1103
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:39,139
 how often does it happen not very often especially when you got a program job

1104
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:47,380
 like this I can't imagine it's gonna happen a lot but we don't we don't get

1105
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:52,260
 one once once materials located in the position it needs to be it then it

1106
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:59,780
 doesn't get moved until unless you're putting it in yeah you know you haven't

1107
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,540
 got installers yeah and it's in our way and you're meant to have done it last

1108
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:07,580
 week that's the your fault yeah well that's not double handling that's me we

1109
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:10,460
 just get the hell out of the way you you're causing the issues your products

1110
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:15,580
 in the way you're not installing it okay I've got to move it that's my cost you

1111
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:20,340
 know off the truck and you know your area is not ready until tomorrow so you

1112
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:24,500
 need to sit a steel each off to the side and then bring him around which is

1113
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:29,340
 double-handle it's not really no because he's only lifted it off the truck first

1114
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,060
 time then he's got to move it to where I've got to get it to my location

1115
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:38,100
 that's fine it's yeah that's all right

1116
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:43,140
 I'll get him the manitou and stick the tines under him and move them for you

1117
01:35:43,140 --> 01:36:00,740
 no no no no no no no no no no we don't have a lot of waste anyway we're minimal

1118
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:07,060
 on the project we're very minimal it's you know silicon tubes cloths whatever

1119
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:09,280
 and that's only minimal because everything's done in the factory right

1120
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,060
 you get a fair bit of that because I've picked that much up it up over the years

1121
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:18,540
 that's that's a been to a central location Nathan yeah that's the standard

1122
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,500
 that's the standard way of operating yeah okay yep

1123
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:27,860
 I'll talk before number 14 security thing sir you take just take we'll take

1124
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:36,260
 yeah well take 14 out oh well no I'm not gonna do it you know I'm not doing

1125
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:40,820
 signage your perimeter fencing to the job

1126
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:45,099
 you're doing your own exclusions own signage and barricades and yes I in

1127
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:51,980
 brackets exclusion zone I'll put next to that exclusion zone by me yeah yeah

1128
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:58,540
 Dale got it exclusions I invite a fg4 my for our works okay

1129
01:37:01,099 --> 01:37:07,460
 yeah I love number 16 I love when a subby tells me what my fucking job is

1130
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:13,500
 it's the best you'd be surprised what sort of builders we've had to work with

1131
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,220
 over the years that you have to spell this out too so the main site fence in

1132
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:22,620
 the barricade is fine yeah it's your exclusion zones again you're gonna

1133
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:27,660
 maintain your own yeah exclusion zones are fine I just need to remind you about

1134
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:30,500
 your hoarding and back

1135
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:37,700
 yeah I think that's all about your excuses up yeah I think production would

1136
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:41,980
 catch take some bottomless screens wouldn't write this stuff that the

1137
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:47,460
 contracts you bastard sent us where is like this is what 80 pages you what you

1138
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:53,700
 send us is a bloody encyclopedia of things that I need to do number 17 so

1139
01:37:53,700 --> 01:38:01,059
 my number 17 is irrelevant no worse than anyone else yeah yeah I think I'm seeing

1140
01:38:01,059 --> 01:38:07,099
 this goes let's go down on track man you're probably gonna be aggressive

1141
01:38:07,099 --> 01:38:14,220
 across the job yes as we're going as so what our in our guy on site does is he

1142
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:19,620
 unpacks the panels prior to launch he peels the external tape off he leaves

1143
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:23,660
 the protection on the glass and let's see you guys direct us otherwise he makes

1144
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:27,300
 sure there's no silicon marks he squeegees the panel down and then he

1145
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:36,059
 then he launches it right so that's the trade clean yes yeah protection excluded

1146
01:38:36,059 --> 01:38:39,260
 that needs to be updated

1147
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:52,060
 yeah what's the other yellow one you got highlighted you had another one I think

1148
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:56,740
 there you go

1149
01:38:56,740 --> 01:39:01,940
 that's like those sharks can you make sure on the template that says TFG in

1150
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:06,340
 the future doubt I don't want that in there yeah

1151
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:12,580
 yeah do you want to offload children's trucks from that's all right let's be

1152
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:21,180
 close to say I'll offload so we'll change that so that X needs to move into

1153
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:25,100
 TFG Dale I'm gonna offload their own tracks with the manatee all right so

1154
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:36,540
 move that X into TFG yeah so what he wants got a move yeah so that's got a move yeah

1155
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:46,180
 it should say a minute to this is well 23 that's all right so I thought so I

1156
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:52,500
 don't know that needs to be a minute to you that not be direct lifted from

1157
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,980
 tracks look it can be I don't care what he uses as long as it works

1158
01:39:55,980 --> 01:40:05,620
 that's how I just want to 1223 is TFG yeah yeah yeah 26 move parts for access

1159
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:11,940
 of other trades so that's that's that's that's a double handling one that's the

1160
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:15,900
 double handling one so if you want to move it I don't want you to move it all

1161
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:21,460
 on you got to tell me to do it I don't want I don't want the you know one of

1162
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:25,700
 the internal fitting guys to touch it

1163
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:29,020
 yes yeah

1164
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:40,380
 yeah see that once you know change that night yeah for you you're supplying your

1165
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:49,340
 exclusions yeah yeah so put put 27 dial 27 you got to put the X in TFG okay and

1166
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:55,140
 leave that comment in there yep yep and leave the comment in there yeah yep

1167
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:58,140
 30

1168
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:06,540
 let's be updated you can just take the build a one hour in the other 30 yeah

1169
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:13,660
 leave the X in TFG TFG but the comment of if for some reason there's a hoist or a

1170
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:21,820
 crane on the doors fine but yeah I mean it's logical we won't happen mean

1171
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,340
 material hoist system material hoist

1172
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:33,980
 sight crane and drivers we can you just fuck that off yeah just take item 32

1173
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:40,420
 actually just strike it like it just 32 day old yeah just just put a line

1174
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:46,980
 through it because it's actually not needed so this is one of your standard

1175
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:57,980
 forms is it yeah the first builder in the last seven jobs he's read this just

1176
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:13,580
 so you know thank you for helping us update our documents right that's all

1177
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:15,700
 right

1178
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:26,139
 there's no exclusions aren't by art well if it's for site traffic the truck

1179
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:31,220
 itself it's the truck yeah like you're gonna have a loading area that I come

1180
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:37,900
 into that's gonna be exclusive for loading I'm not gonna yeah yeah that's

1181
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:47,620
 what that means yeah yeah yeah each floor that just next central location

1182
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:53,020
 yeah just put central location Dale where he's highlighted yellow they just

1183
01:42:53,020 --> 01:43:04,140
 put rubbish bin collection bins central location yeah it's not 47 stories high

1184
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:10,020
 we can cross that we can remove that if you want

1185
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:16,580
 sort of stops us at the movie it'll sail straight past the one anyway so you sort

1186
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:24,460
 of irrelevant yeah that's right yeah it's irrelevant okay what's the next one

1187
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:32,900
 so permanent being your credit provided by if applicable yeah there is no being

1188
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:42,059
 the or cradle that's applicable it's just right through general contractor

1189
01:43:42,059 --> 01:43:45,780
 sliding that's good just a builder everywhere if you do a word search for

1190
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:53,059
 builder choice to slip it past yeah yeah we do that we'd like to know that's

1191
01:43:53,059 --> 01:43:57,380
 just a slip kid he's right though dad we should say by builder instead of GC

1192
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:01,460
 because if you ever do a word search makes it easier for them and why do not

1193
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:08,340
 toss lining listed twice it was already on the previous page was it yeah sure

1194
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:15,900
 we're gonna provide twice as much I guess I've dated a foot drinking water

1195
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:38,660
 you guys really haven't worked in Asia do we have to hold it when you go for

1196
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:45,700
 yeah I don't know what others other than PGA there's nothing else I mean yes no

1197
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:50,980
 like if you're gonna have defibs on the floors or something like that yeah yeah

1198
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:54,380
 you get this that's all

1199
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:06,099
 Boston substrates me a main thing yeah okay he values to give him seven yeah

1200
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:16,420
 yeah the nickel sulfide inclusion like whatever position is on that that's why

1201
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:27,420
 I'll honor it in the facade spare inhabit have a section for it says you

1202
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:33,700
 can you can have it and it's got to be you know it's it's got to be tested and

1203
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:38,420
 the failure rate should be X and so many panels so if we fall outside of that

1204
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:43,820
 failure rate then it becomes the glass supplies of my issue if it falls within

1205
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:52,580
 that that you know condition and it then it's a cost to the client that because

1206
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:56,220
 it's it's obviously it's an issue that you can't get away from but it's a very

1207
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:07,100
 minimal issue I guess we need to make sure that we qualify that in our

1208
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:15,140
 submission to NAPL that with the this issue is based on inhabits

1209
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:22,700
 specification back to back your comment with what's included in the inhabit yeah

1210
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:28,380
 spec you know we've allowed you know a failure rate of X has been a bit spanked

1211
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:33,980
 anything beyond that yeah well I'll just point I'll finish that comment and say

1212
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:43,460
 we are we are we are following the inhabit specification following yeah

1213
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:49,620
 yeah that's exactly what Dale that comment there we just got to refer to

1214
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:57,660
 the toughened glass section of the facade specification from inhabit so we

1215
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:02,780
 just put the you put the facade specification the revision the document

1216
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:12,340
 number the page and the number that refers to that area yeah yeah yep so

1217
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:17,420
 we'll be very clear that the following that not really much of a topic anymore

1218
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:22,020
 because everyone's familiar with it

1219
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:30,820
 sorry I've still had a case or two on it

1220
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:36,500
 still happens all right acoustic performance that's just one why I think

1221
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:42,540
 we get he's everything we'll get it signed off prior all that yeah that's

1222
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:46,340
 he's already done a bit of a base assessment on the system we put forward

1223
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:53,340
 and said should achieve 43 as long as if that's the line that the client mapple

1224
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:56,820
 takes with where they want the facade to be then you know that's what we follow

1225
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:00,300
 and he's already confirmed it

1226
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,580
 awesome defects inspection yeah we'll use I think they're one that will use

1227
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:22,380
 we use simple the defects right scroll down oh yeah this box what's bolts

1228
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:27,860
 connecting fixing down on medium frame shall we stay laminated glass yeah so

1229
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:32,140
 bolts connecting fixing brackets down so we can't have you know what we're trying

1230
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:36,660
 to say is if the architect turns around and says no I don't want stainless steel

1231
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:39,660
 I want galvanized well hold on so I got I've got to have the right material I

1232
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:44,180
 can't have you know galvanized steel on a medium I need to have the right

1233
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:52,740
 that's good yeah I'm not a glass yeah that's fine SGPs the best

1234
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:55,900
 interlayer you can get

1235
01:49:00,019 --> 01:49:07,180
 model will do only one list to be used yeah so I hate getting a client list an

1236
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:12,580
 architect list a list from your mom Ben CC that's always gonna happen that

1237
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:16,620
 makes a necessary back to life because yeah we present to a client to wear

1238
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:24,300
 ready but then we need we need a coordinated list or we made the voice

1239
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:28,260
 you fact of the way it works well we have to get we have to get it ready for

1240
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,340
 the client inspection so you're gonna have your own defects then you have our

1241
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:35,660
 defects then the client gets presented with it you can't have the client

1242
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:43,260
 represent reviewing it before it's ready so what the issue with that is oh well

1243
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:48,180
 then I need to find is exactly who's gonna inspect it once and then twice

1244
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:52,540
 because I don't want the same issue getting raised multiple times like you

1245
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:56,740
 know if we we resolve something with you then the client comes back and says well

1246
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:00,540
 no actually I want you to respray that or touch this then I'm doing things

1247
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:04,780
 multiple times right and I'm arguing multiple times about something the idea

1248
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:10,179
 is to corral things so you know we we work through an area get it handed over

1249
01:50:10,179 --> 01:50:14,780
 move on to the next one you know like through the defects there really should

1250
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:18,780
 be three lists there should be your list yeah of course my principal contractors

1251
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:25,500
 list and then the clients always got the privilege to inspect their work yeah so

1252
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,500
 there's always a way of waste and there shouldn't be any defects anyway so

1253
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:36,460
 exactly exactly so if we say only one list to be used it can you take all

1254
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:42,020
 three lists and at least put it in one list. They can occur at separate times.

1255
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:47,460
 So that way it says client defect CC defect TFG defect but it's all on one

1256
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:52,300
 list I just don't want three different schedules being issued. If you get three

1257
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:57,620
 just send them to me and I'll merge them for you. Thanks Ben you're a good man.

1258
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:04,420
 I don't want to talk about it anymore.

1259
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:19,220
 So future damage by others. Get rid of the number two is out.

1260
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:32,420
 Get rid of two. Yeah number two gone. Dale two gone.

1261
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:45,140
 Joint inspection. What do you do that smoking a joint? Not a problem.

1262
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:50,020
 The quality of the rolling of the Julie.

1263
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:57,700
 Currently no defects future damage if any. Well I suppose yeah we need to

1264
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:02,020
 I'll be able to hand over an area if that's what's going to happen. Yeah but

1265
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:06,660
 this is more for like. And we need that ourselves because we don't want we need

1266
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:11,660
 to make sure when you've completed there is no damage that you can then blame on

1267
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:22,059
 somebody else. Yeah. They speak to you and you need to figure out who it was.

1268
01:52:22,059 --> 01:52:27,300
 Honestly in our careers has any of that ever been clear enough anyway?

1269
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:33,580
 Do you worry us fine? You have warranties.

1270
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:42,220
 Replacement of any components damaged by others. I guess not at your cost but we will need it.

1271
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:46,540
 Yeah of course we're just saying the cost of it you know it's just saying

1272
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:52,380
 again the internal guys drives drives through a door and you know.

1273
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:59,260
 So cost of replacement of any damaged by others. Just put the word cost in

1274
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:04,220
 front of it Dale. Cost of any replacement. Replacement of cost of

1275
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:13,620
 replacement. Yep easy. The warranties are just we just that's back to back with

1276
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:18,580
 everything. It is so originally we had this was actually a discussion at the

1277
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:25,940
 start this is now aligned with the inhabit warranty schedule for the

1278
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:32,620
 project. Before it wasn't now it is. So do you want us to just put that in there?

1279
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:41,900
 Just say yeah it makes it super clear. Yeah so maybe under item 3 create a new

1280
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:47,299
 item for and say this is as per the inhabit spec revision da da da da.

1281
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:59,100
 We'll put it after 3. Yeah. 5 is an interesting one. Yeah.

1282
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:06,740
 He talks through 5. Right no claim to the durability service life. So what we're saying is

1283
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:16,700
 you you inhabit and architect have nominated a a product that we followed

1284
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:23,740
 the warranties and the life cycle of that product right and what we're saying

1285
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:30,820
 is you know that that that's what we followed and you know we're applicable

1286
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:32,900
 that are dependent on you like I'm saying I guess I'm just trying to make

1287
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,420
 sure I say this right way we may not consider really service last year so

1288
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:41,340
 we're saying you've you've given us a glass we've installed it in Newcastle

1289
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:47,140
 you ought to be aware of the conditions around it if that glass that coating

1290
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:53,740
 that you've nominated was not suitable for that location and it degrades

1291
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:58,500
 against the warranty that it's under I'm not you can't come back and get me for

1292
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,940
 it if it's if it's not suitable so if we come back in five years time and you say

1293
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:07,220
 to me the paint we nominated on the job has fallen apart and we find out that

1294
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:11,900
 well hold on a second there was you know a high amount of salt the citizen the

1295
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:15,060
 air or leakage in the building because you left the doors open all the time or

1296
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:19,100
 I don't know that's not my problem I'm not you've nominated the products you've

1297
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:23,580
 nominated the warranty I've given you it if there's something that happens to it

1298
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:27,620
 that's outside of its warranty conditions you know due to its location

1299
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:35,140
 or how the buildings run I'm not liable for it it's got to be used correctly

1300
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:40,020
 against it's what that that what they've nominated the first the first issue is

1301
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:48,420
 they actually haven't nominated the system system that well they've not met

1302
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,180
 yet they they have the best way to put it they've given me a win so this is a

1303
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:55,660
 good one they've given me a wind load all right so let's talk let's use that

1304
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:00,780
 as an example I designed the facade structurally to that wind load if there's

1305
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:06,099
 a failure in five years and we find out that the wind loads are five times that

1306
01:56:06,099 --> 01:56:10,820
 well that's not my problem I won't warrant you again well yeah that's that's

1307
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,380
 a good one that's quite simple but you started talking about paint well just

1308
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:20,460
 just say internally they haven't told us and this is like this is a good one for

1309
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,860
 intended purpose clause right so internally the airport decides bucket

1310
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:32,700
 we're gonna put in a you know right up against the facade we're gonna put in a

1311
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:38,019
 cafe or whatever and then the guys are you know spilling I don't know some sort

1312
01:56:38,019 --> 01:56:42,740
 of acidic water all over the facade it starts to degrade call me up Nathan your

1313
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:45,380
 paint's peeling why is it doing that well hold on second you never told me

1314
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:51,380
 what you're putting there and you know it's it's exceeded the warranty you know

1315
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:56,660
 it's serviceability and it's what it's designed to do I'm not liable for it

1316
01:56:56,660 --> 01:57:00,460
 it's what we're saying is you guys have nominated these products you ought to

1317
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:05,380
 have known a you know what you're doing when you nominated them we've followed

1318
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:09,380
 them if you if you haven't documented what they're going to be for outside of

1319
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:14,220
 what we've already read and if something happens and it's because you put a more

1320
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,380
 onerous condition on the job like a wind load as an example I can't be

1321
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:24,940
 responsible for it and how many times does this happen never zero I think I

1322
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:29,580
 think the big one will be a say a pint you know if it's that you know if

1323
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:34,020
 there's a yeah but if there's a floor in the matter of fact yeah and the pain but

1324
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:38,980
 that's my responsibility yeah that but if that gets hard to you know there'll

1325
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:42,700
 be another shit fight about that well the paint that's a good thing about

1326
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:47,060
 paint right we can test so we get the spectrometer we can test the and we do

1327
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:50,540
 this in the factory anyway but Ben Lawson saw this in the factory all our

1328
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:55,220
 tanks get put under accelerated lifecycle testing for every job so I'll

1329
01:57:55,220 --> 01:58:00,060
 give an example we get the paint for this job we actually get the cut of the

1330
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:05,420
 extrusion we go put it in acidic vats and we accelerate the lifecycle of a

1331
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:09,380
 building on the extrusion to make sure the paints right we even get the tapes

1332
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:14,340
 all right you know the type of protection type and we do adhesion tests

1333
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:18,020
 to make sure there's no residue when it gets peeled off that will affect it five

1334
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:21,500
 years from now like we do all that sort of stuff to make sure that's packed that

1335
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:27,340
 paints correct we do a spectrometer test to get the the amount of microns of

1336
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:31,380
 paint and it's got a match that and we provide all that documentation to

1337
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:35,780
 inhabit during the project to say look we've given you the paint exactly as

1338
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:40,660
 it's supposed to be you know and then it for instance just say there is an area

1339
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:44,940
 on the job and this is happened in the industry just say up on the second floor

1340
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:49,620
 some paint starts to chalk we get up there we get the spectrometer we take

1341
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:53,019
 the paint off to a lab and if we find that there is a defect yeah and it's out

1342
01:58:53,019 --> 01:58:56,340
 and the paint paint is problem because he gave us the wrong grade of paint for

1343
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,940
 that battery of aluminium and we didn't pick it up during our quality control

1344
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:05,300
 then yes I've got to replace that you know that's a hundred percent but again

1345
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:08,820
 how many times has this happened to me on a job in 20 years zero how much have

1346
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:13,179
 I seen it with Chinese suppliers that take shortcuts in the industry in

1347
01:59:13,179 --> 01:59:16,820
 Australia I've seen it a lot in the last 10 years they don't have proper quality

1348
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:22,380
 quality systems the jewel on the Gold Coast is the classic example of that

1349
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:28,900
 with multiplex there's a 14 15 million dollar repainting bill for that job

1350
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:33,660
 yeah they've got 35 panel Peters handle beaters over two years stripping all the

1351
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:41,059
 paint off the off the three buildings and repainting it whoo

1352
01:59:41,059 --> 01:59:48,940
 rusty right what else we got in the event of delays because I was talking

1353
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:56,540
 about that the payment storage panels go and I can't see you really scroll down

1354
01:59:56,540 --> 02:00:06,420
 down yeah here we go yeah so this is let's say the steel doesn't turn up for

1355
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:09,860
 another two months past the date you said it would and I've got to pay four

1356
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:17,380
 grand a month storage fees to store you know longer than what's anticipated you

1357
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:21,780
 know that's that's all that is so what if I end up like on the Newcastle 291

1358
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:25,380
 King Street I ended up storing the panels for six months the entire job and

1359
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:31,180
 I'm still fighting over those costs as it stands and we're at the end of the

1360
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:38,020
 job yeah so if you come back to us and just actually put a right oh and I think

1361
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:45,980
 I think you know there needs to be a grace period in the event of a delays

1362
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:56,219
 because by those we agree yeah yeah because we always have and just just to

1363
02:00:56,219 --> 02:01:01,019
 be clear we we're rolling these panels right so if you say put a full week's

1364
02:01:01,019 --> 02:01:06,339
 grace period and then say you know for X amount of square meters of storage

1365
02:01:06,339 --> 02:01:10,419
 costs four grand a month we can put that on the back of item six if you'd like

1366
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:18,940
 yeah yep yep you got it yeah because what I'll do is what we will do is in

1367
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:23,700
 their recommendation because we'll say based based on the performance of the

1368
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:28,940
 design team and difficulties that you know we need to allow for storage

1369
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:34,020
 because we're not confident where the designs gonna be at that'd be a good one

1370
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:42,780
 for Jamie to digest mm-hmm just there there is no just looking at that site

1371
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:46,220
 there is no other than the floor there is no room on that side is it we're

1372
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:55,100
 really locked in aren't we yeah bring him lift them up put them in that's it

1373
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:57,100
 okay

1374
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:07,120
 scroll down

1375
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:12,200
 yeah

1376
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:19,060
 okay yeah

1377
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:24,260
 that you guys have that

1378
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:27,940
 I can see your screen. Yeah. Yeah

1379
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,180
 That's my

1380
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:37,180
 Disappear commercially agree that

1381
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,540
 Yeah

1382
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:44,900
 You guys obviously I did how does it work when you're a managing contractor when it comes to this

1383
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:51,900
 Well, you can't really call this managing contractor

1384
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:53,900
 So you're you're you're gonna do BGs

1385
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:55,900
 No it's cash retention

1386
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,900
 I'll do cash retention for the job

1387
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,900
 Because doesn't that retention have to go into a trust account

1388
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:01,900
 No

1389
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:03,900
 That's wherever you guys keep it

1390
02:03:03,900 --> 02:03:05,900
 I'd say

1391
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,900
 I don't I don't I don't

1392
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:09,900
 I don't I don't I don't

1393
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,900
 I don't I don't I don't

1394
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,900
 I don't I don't I don't

1395
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:15,900
 I don't I think that's honey

1396
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:16,900
 for

1397
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,900
 Rezzy at the moment, right?

1398
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:22,900
 This fits not class two

1399
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,900
 is a bond

1400
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:27,900
 Yeah, there's no time if we were doing Rezzy building

1401
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,900
 It would have to go

1402
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,900
 It's coming back. Yeah

1403
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,900
 Not yet

1404
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,900
 Yeah, so the damages

1405
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:42,900
 So the normal normal normal conditions are

1406
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,900
 5% retention

1407
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:50,900
 Yes

1408
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,900
 Up to 10%

1409
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,900
 10% up to 5

1410
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,900
 Yeah, that's standing

1411
02:03:56,900 --> 02:04:00,900
 Yeah, so you guys will do 10% each claim until we reach five of the contract sum

1412
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,900
 Yep, and then it reduces it

1413
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,900
 To two and a half

1414
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,900
 Yeah, that's normal

1415
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,900
 That's normal

1416
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,900
 That's normal. Yep

1417
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,900
 That's that. Yep. So why didn't you put the normal one in there?

1418
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:21,900
 Yep, that's okay. We'll say 10% until five five percent achieved. We'll update that. Okay. Yep. Okay, Dale. We'll do that. Yep

1419
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:30,900
 How else we talked about this one here is about liquid added damages, okay. Oh, sorry

1420
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,900
 Liquid added damages. Yeah

1421
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,900
 I

1422
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:45,200
 Maximum point oh six to five percent of working here and then a limited to a given I don't understand that

1423
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,400
 Yes, yeah

1424
02:04:55,099 --> 02:05:01,299
 But you you guys have probably got a contract there that already stipulates that I haven't seen it if you've got a number you need

1425
02:05:01,299 --> 02:05:03,940
 To tell us what that is. Like if they've already imposed that

1426
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:08,040
 Yeah, we'll back to back it with what we caught in the bum

1427
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:12,679
 And but scale to the value of one works. Yeah

1428
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:18,440
 And get back to you I'll propose something

1429
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,580
 That of course you will whatever it is proposing that Harvard

1430
02:05:26,919 --> 02:05:28,919
 Why didn't you highlight

1431
02:05:29,839 --> 02:05:31,839
 The thing

1432
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,840
 That

1433
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:44,280
 Please note the condition of tender is acceptance of minimum advanced payment 20%

1434
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,960
 So you want to fuck a million dollars?

1435
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:51,280
 That's of the production value not of the complete contract

1436
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,640
 So it's about five six hundred grand for this job

1437
02:05:54,640 --> 02:06:01,440
 And that locks in all the materials for the job in the production so that goes against the glassy aluminium in the production slot

1438
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:05,280
 So we give you half a million bucks. We've got no protection

1439
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:08,040
 Yeah, so

1440
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:11,280
 To get that through now. We'll need a big a

1441
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,080
 Okay

1442
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:17,280
 Okay, I want

1443
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:30,519
 Okay understood I'll go back and talk to the guys about that I think the first I think the first thing you would do is

1444
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:34,080
 Bang in a claim

1445
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,400
 straight away for

1446
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:42,180
 This pre-tip for all the work and engineering you've done up front and trying it a little bit head there

1447
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,940
 I feel so

1448
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:48,420
 Most most client you pity hit the nail on the head most of the class we're working with at the moment is saying look

1449
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:55,540
 Front leg the first couple of claims with your design works and engineering and then use that to pay your materials. That's that's been

1450
02:06:56,180 --> 02:07:00,020
 The last two three jobs we've done that's been more common

1451
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:04,780
 We're gonna have to have this conversation with them because

1452
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:11,520
 They they get a boy. Hi, they will look for 20 cents in the claim. All right, these bikes. They just fucking

1453
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:13,520
 they're just

1454
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:19,400
 And it's like it's a success for WT as well. Hey, yeah, I'll go to QS

1455
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:20,960
 Yes

1456
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:25,380
 So they'll go hang on 10% of the job isn't installed fuck off

1457
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:27,960
 So what we'll do

1458
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:32,720
 Our dial will I think we leave that one in there and we need to talk about that with an apple

1459
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:36,840
 So can't wait. Um, yes, we need to agree it

1460
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:42,800
 Yeah, and then take it to them. Yeah. Yeah, and not similarly date

1461
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,920
 They won't do it without a BJ. It's what's our contract?

1462
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:51,160
 Okay, so number 14. Do you guys understand number 14?

1463
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,640
 Yeah, so as you put it on the ship, you want some cash?

1464
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,160
 Yeah, so we'll we'll

1465
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:01,160
 Still ensure it warrant it and be responsible for it

1466
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:05,720
 But we will be putting it into the clients name and saying it's yours

1467
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:07,720
 The value of it

1468
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,960
 upon the payment and our production

1469
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,960
 business releases

1470
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:20,320
 The shipping documents because it'll be on the water to us and says there you go. You can now get it off the wharf

1471
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:24,160
 It's yours. Yeah, so this is the condition of our production facility

1472
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:30,040
 This is where this comes from and this is because over the last couple of years this particular to the Australian market

1473
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:35,840
 Clients not making payments has become an issue and the Asian suppliers are nervous. So now this is a

1474
02:08:36,519 --> 02:08:39,000
 This is now a condition from our factory

1475
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:41,880
 It's always been there. I've always had to pay

1476
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:47,480
 Um when you when you when you were working with say it's here one

1477
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,720
 Fabricator Mr. Liza that I care they'll they'll cash flow themselves

1478
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:55,480
 but a lot of the a lot of them now, which I'm

1479
02:08:55,480 --> 02:09:00,759
 Trying to fight against a lot of them are trying to push for LC's now. They're trying to go back to LC's in the Australian

1480
02:09:00,759 --> 02:09:03,480
 Market, which you know, I keep saying it's not gonna happen

1481
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:05,839
 and

1482
02:09:05,839 --> 02:09:07,839
 You know your lines of credit, right, you know, we've get

1483
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,360
 you know, so a lot of pushing that but

1484
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:14,959
 Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to enter into it on this job. But um

1485
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:20,759
 That's that's that's anyway, that's something I think yeah, we buy

1486
02:09:21,759 --> 02:09:24,160
 Everybody understands we buy lifts the same way

1487
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,160
 which is no different to this

1488
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:29,320
 Generally, they provide us with VG. Don't they?

1489
02:09:30,519 --> 02:09:32,519
 Correct

1490
02:09:32,519 --> 02:09:34,519
 That's the only difference

1491
02:09:34,519 --> 02:09:36,519
 There's no security against

1492
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:38,519
 Yep

1493
02:09:38,519 --> 02:09:42,040
 So, you know, don't I you know, we pay deposit then we pay

1494
02:09:42,559 --> 02:09:47,200
 You know, once it's shipped just like this. They send the bill alert and then yeah, then

1495
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:49,200
 If they claim it's VG before it

1496
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,200
 Yeah, yeah, what what I want to do

1497
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:54,360
 with these comments that particularly

1498
02:09:55,240 --> 02:10:01,480
 13 14 and the progress pay monthly progress payments. There's a schedule down below. I

1499
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:07,000
 Want to have that written in a way that we all agree prior to any award

1500
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,880
 So the the idea is if we go down there should be a schedule a little bit further down

1501
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,360
 Yeah this year

1502
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,160
 I want to update this to reflect whatever it is

1503
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,880
 We're going to agree

1504
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:27,880
 That way it's done up front and then

1505
02:10:28,519 --> 02:10:31,559
 The cash for the job and the cash flows locked in at the start

1506
02:10:31,559 --> 02:10:37,400
 that way I can make and because these discussions I have in parallel obviously with my supply chain and

1507
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:42,599
 Then your client you guys and us have got it all locked away and it's not a discussion during the project

1508
02:10:43,639 --> 02:10:45,080
 so

1509
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:51,080
 Whatever the item 13 and 14 becomes impacts this but this is quite an important

1510
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:57,160
 Discussion to have with NAPL in terms of understanding cash flow for the job because this for me locks away the project

1511
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:01,000
 From a cash flow perspective and then it's that's it. It's done

1512
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,360
 We don't have to we don't really have to have to talk about it other than doing your assessments each month on percentages of completion

1513
02:11:08,519 --> 02:11:10,519
 Yeah

1514
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,280
 We need to have it locked away and especially yet all those so

1515
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:19,360
 Can I just step you through the logic of it a little bit?

1516
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:22,240
 And I am conscious. I know I've taken a bloody time

1517
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:27,520
 But item one is you know, the prelims that are above the facade, right?

1518
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:33,120
 that's all our engineering and design and all that we just take that number and

1519
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:37,880
 You know, it's excluding site works and we divide it by the

1520
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:42,400
 Duration of the project and it works out to about 120 grand per month. That's how we do that

1521
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:50,200
 Then the then you've got material deposits, which we just spoke about which is item 13, which we've got

1522
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,720
 Yep, and then the bill of lading claims

1523
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:57,040
 That 2.1 million split over all the shipping

1524
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:03,160
 Alright, so you take that number you split it by all the stages. I guess that we're shipping and

1525
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,880
 That's those payments

1526
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:13,120
 And that's those payments and then the last one is the site installation payment, which is we install

1527
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:19,200
 We put a claim in on the 25th. You pay it whatever the duration after us pay your contract

1528
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,200
 That's your standard site installation payment

1529
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:33,120
 So does that have to work out I mean that that the bill of lading stuff

1530
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:37,640
 That's gonna be so so understanding we can only claim once a month, right

1531
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,640
 Yep, so we can forecast

1532
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:45,599
 What that's going to be often what what happens is

1533
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:48,240
 for the first couple

1534
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:51,440
 Like, you know, usually by the yourself

1535
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:57,480
 Someone from CCS comes up and puts a hand on the product or they have an independent because it's obviously inhabit have an office in

1536
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,480
 Bangkok they'll send a guy

1537
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:03,519
 Walks in the factory guys have a looks all the product says yep. Yep. They're loading it in

1538
02:13:04,559 --> 02:13:09,639
 You know so you can do the assessment all that sort of thing and get ready for that payment

1539
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,440
 When it needs to come

1540
02:13:13,639 --> 02:13:15,639
 Yeah

1541
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:26,440
 Well, usually you engage someone locally up there to go and inspect you'd maybe come up once yourself to have a look at it

1542
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:31,200
 We can we can fly someone up for that. But you know, we're not going to do 10 12 trips

1543
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:35,120
 So, you know for every single shipment because we might have 12 ships that we're putting containers on

1544
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:38,120
 What?

1545
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:40,120
 But in the habit

1546
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:47,519
 In habit inhabit have an office over there so they'll just have a guy he drives down 40 minutes out of Bangkok

1547
02:13:47,839 --> 02:13:52,719
 Stands there for an hour or two looks at it and then leaves right and that's just so you guys have got a

1548
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:58,160
 Surety that you know what we're putting in the containers is what we're actually say we're doing because we'll send you pictures and we'll show

1549
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,880
 You it and now guys will be over there doing it, but it's just

1550
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:05,760
 You know the client wants to know they're paying they're paying for something and it's actual real, right?

1551
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:09,960
 Just I'm sure you did the same with lifts, right when they're lighting it up in China

1552
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:12,240
 I'm sure you have somebody go and have a look at it, right? Oh

1553
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,280
 No, oh

1554
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:17,320
 Really?

1555
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:23,920
 Oh, really, okay, I'm gonna say they could be due to answer that question the answer

1556
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:29,840
 Well, okay, well maybe not I look I'm a reputable companies. Sorry

1557
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:36,000
 What did you say you're working with reputable companies

1558
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:46,520
 I was waiting for feedback on that one. Right, right, well this is a good start what we need to do now get all this cleaned up

1559
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:52,220
 Get get that pricing schedule cleaned up and then yeah, then Dale will need to have a

1560
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:55,320
 meeting with Jamie and

1561
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,480
 right, and we'll get a draft together of the

1562
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:04,719
 The you know the justification for single select etc, etc

1563
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:08,080
 Yeah, and then we'll have to sit down with him

1564
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:11,919
 Yeah, and then there might but there might be another quick one

1565
02:15:12,959 --> 02:15:20,519
 With we're gonna have to do a formal post tender where we take a look at our form and go through everything

1566
02:15:20,519 --> 02:15:25,959
 But and if you want to do this one, so now and the client sits in that meeting

1567
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:31,560
 Yeah, so that all the time we do that that it's we're already in agreeance with

1568
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:33,840
 all of these

1569
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:36,240
 Items. Yeah, and that we're not

1570
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:45,040
 In there be if we can get some clarity of 1314 we need to get those things sort of

1571
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:52,680
 Agree with the client as well as well as this schedule and what those things look like that

1572
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:59,560
 And what they seem to look like that's like babies and stuff if we need to say yes, these guys need to allow for it. Yeah

1573
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,280
 Yeah

1574
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:06,920
 Yeah, one thing I learned from BG. The other thing is can you get BG?

1575
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:10,440
 the the one for the 600 grand

1576
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,600
 Won't be an issue. I'm not going to provide one on the material

1577
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:19,640
 Well, I'll double check but I don't think is an issue with the six hundred thousand one

1578
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:23,680
 But I'm not going to provide one for the bill of laden payments for completed materials

1579
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,960
 But for item number two, I don't think that'll be an issue

1580
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:31,080
 Yeah, that might be

1581
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,280
 Yeah point

1582
02:16:37,559 --> 02:16:40,800
 Yeah in Cascale someone

1583
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:44,440
 Big brother provided

1584
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:49,600
 No, they because what they're saying is we finish the materials. It's leaving on the ship you

1585
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:57,200
 Pay for it that I'm that I'm kick because they're their contracts not for installation. They're there. He's the materials you pay for it

1586
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,320
 It's yours. We'll put it in your name. There's a vesting a say vesting certificate in there

1587
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:09,640
 And all our clients that we work with, you know have accepted it and it puts the the product in whoever's name is

1588
02:17:09,639 --> 02:17:14,840
 It's further down it's further down in the document. Yeah, it's an attachment it's

1589
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
 Yeah, it it

1590
02:17:18,039 --> 02:17:22,680
 basically says the material is owned by the father client and

1591
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:27,840
 But the responsibility for it the insurance and warranty is by me

1592
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:33,119
 You know for the material so that or any costs associated with it until handover

1593
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:36,879
 You know, that's basically how it works, but it's a good it's a good thing

1594
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:39,719
 And it's been vetted by a different obviously different

1595
02:17:40,639 --> 02:17:45,480
 Builders lawyers over the last two years. So it's it's robust

1596
02:17:51,959 --> 02:17:54,359
 Yeah, it's it's further down in there

1597
02:17:55,639 --> 02:17:59,199
 Yeah, that's fine. I don't think I had anything else I lighted

1598
